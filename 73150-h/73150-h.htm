<p><i>His Appearance in the World</i></p>

<p>Democracy came into the Western World to
the tune of sweet, soft music. There was, at the
start, no harsh bawling from below; there was
only a dulcet twittering from above. Democratic
man thus began as an ideal being, full of
ineffable virtues and romantic wrongs—in brief,
as Rousseau’s noble savage in smock and jerkin,
brought out of the tropical wilds to shame the
lords and masters of the civilized lands. The
fact continues to have important consequences
to this day. It remains impossible, as it was in
the Eighteenth Century, to separate the democratic
idea from the theory that there is a mystical
merit, an esoteric and ineradicable
rectitude, in the man at the bottom of the scale—that
inferiority, by some strange magic, becomes
a sort of superiority—nay, the superiority
of superiorities. Everywhere on earth, save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
where the enlightenment of the modern age is confessedly
in transient eclipse, the movement is
toward the completer and more enamoured enfranchisement
of the lower orders. Down there,
one hears, lies a deep, illimitable reservoir of
righteousness and wisdom, unpolluted by the
corruption of privilege. What baffles statesmen
is to be solved by the people, instantly and by a
sort of seraphic intuition. Their yearnings are
pure; they alone are capable of a perfect patriotism;
in them is the only hope of peace and
happiness on this lugubrious ball. The cure for
the evils of democracy is more democracy!</p>

<p>This notion, as I hint, originated in the poetic
fancy of gentlemen on the upper levels—sentimentalists
who, observing to their distress that
the ass was over-laden, proposed to reform transport
by putting him into the cart. A stale
Christian bilge ran through their veins, though
many of them, as it happened, toyed with what
is now called Modernism. They were the direct
ancestors of the more saccharine Liberals
of to-day, who yet mouth their tattered phrases
and dream their preposterous dreams. I can
find no record that these phrases, in the beginning,
made much impression upon the actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
objects of their rhetoric. Early democratic man
seems to have given little thought to the democratic
ideal, and less veneration. What he
wanted was something concrete and highly materialistic—more
to eat, less work, higher wages,
lower taxes. He had no apparent belief in the
acroamatic virtue of his own class, and certainly
none in its capacity to rule. His aim was not
to exterminate the baron, but simply to bring
the baron back to a proper discharge of baronial
business. When, by the wild shooting that
naturally accompanies all mob movements, the
former end was accidentally accomplished, and
men out of the mob began to take on baronial
airs, the mob itself quickly showed its opinion
of them by butchering them deliberately and in
earnest. Once the pikes were out, indeed, it was
a great deal more dangerous to be a tribune of
the people than to be an ornament of the old order.
The more copiously the blood gushed, the
nearer that old order came to resurrection. The
Paris proletariat, having been misled into killing
its King in 1793, devoted the next two years to
killing those who had misled it, and by the middle
of 1796 it had another King in fact, and in
three years more he was King <i lang="la">de jure</i>, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
attendant herd of barons, counts, marquises and
dukes, some of them new but most of them old,
to guard, symbolize and execute his sovereignty.
And he and they were immensely popular—so
popular that half of France leaped to suicide that
their glory might blind the world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, there had been a certain
seeping down of democratic theory from
the metaphysicians to the mob—obscured by the
uproar, but still going on. Rhetoric, like a
stealthy plague, was doing its immemorial work.
Where men were confronted by the harsh, exigent
realities of battle and pillage, as they were
everywhere on the Continent, it got into their
veins only slowly, but where they had time to
listen to oratory, as in England and, above all, in
America, it fetched them more quickly. Eventually,
as the world grew exhausted and the
wars passed, it began to make its effects felt
everywhere. Democratic man, contemplating
himself, was suddenly warmed by the spectacle.
His condition had plainly improved. Once a
slave, he was now only a serf. Once condemned
to silence, he was now free to criticize his masters,
and even to flout them, and the ordinances of
God with them. As he gained skill and fluency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
at that sombre and fascinating art, he began to
heave in wonder at his own merit. He was not
only, it appeared, free to praise and damn, challenge
and remonstrate; he was also gifted with a
peculiar rectitude of thought and will, and a
high talent for ideas, particularly on the political
plane. So his wishes, in his mind, began to
take on the dignity of legal rights, and after a
while, of intrinsic and natural rights, and by the
same token the wishes of his masters sank to the
level of mere ignominious lusts. By 1828 in
America and by 1848 in Europe the doctrine had
arisen that all moral excellence, and with it all
pure and unfettered sagacity, resided in the inferior
four-fifths of mankind. In 1867 a philosopher
out of the gutter pushed that doctrine to
its logical conclusion. He taught that the superior
minority had no virtues at all, and hence
no rights at all—that the world belonged exclusively
and absolutely to those who hewed its
wood and drew its water. In less than half a
century he had more followers in the world, open
and covert, than any other sophist since the age
of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Since then, to be sure, there has been a considerable
recession from that extreme position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
The dictatorship of the proletariat, tried here
and there, has turned out to be—if I may venture
a prejudiced judgment—somewhat impracticable.
Even the most advanced Liberals, observing
the thing in being, have been moved to cough
sadly behind their hands. But it would certainly
be going beyond the facts to say that the
underlying democratic dogma has been abandoned,
or even appreciably overhauled. To the
contrary, it is now more prosperous than ever
before. The late war was fought in its name,
and it was embraced with loud hosannas by all
the defeated nations. Everywhere in Christendom
it is now official, save in a few benighted
lands where God is temporarily asleep. Everywhere
its fundamental axioms are accepted: (<i>a</i>)
that the great masses of men have an inalienable
right, born of the very nature of things, to govern
themselves, and (<i>b</i>) that they are competent
to do it. Are they occasionally detected in gross
and lamentable imbecilities? Then it is only
because they are misinformed by those who
would exploit them: the remedy is more education.
Are they, at times, seen to be a trifle
naughty, even swinish? Then it is only a natural
reaction against the oppressions they suffer:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the remedy is to deliver them. The central aim
of all the Christian governments of to-day, in
theory if not in fact, is to further their liberation,
to augment their power, to drive ever larger
and larger pipes into the great reservoir of their
natural wisdom. That government is called
good which responds most quickly and accurately
to their desires and ideas. That is called
bad which conditions their omnipotence and puts
a question mark after their omniscience.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_9">2.</h3>

<p><i>Varieties of Homo Sapiens</i></p>

<p>So much for the theory. It seems to me, and
I shall here contend, that all the known facts lie
flatly against it—that there is actually no more
evidence for the wisdom of the inferior man, nor
for his virtue, than there is for the notion that
Friday is an unlucky day. There was, perhaps,
some excuse for believing in these phantasms in
the days when they were first heard of in the
world, for it was then difficult to put them to the
test, and what cannot be tried and disproved has
always had a lascivious lure for illogical man.
But now we know a great deal more about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
content and character of the human mind than
we used to know, both on high levels and on low
levels, and what we have learned has pretty well
disposed of the old belief in its congenital intuitions
and inherent benevolences. It is, we
discover, a function, at least mainly, of purely
physical and chemical phenomena, and its development
and operation are subject to precisely
the same natural laws which govern the development
and operation, say, of the human nose or
lungs. There are minds which start out with a
superior equipment, and proceed to high and
arduous deeds; there are minds which never get
any further than a sort of insensate sweating,
like that of a kidney. We not only observe such
differences; we also begin to chart them with
more or less accuracy. Of one mind we may
say with some confidence that it shows an extraordinary
capacity for function and development—that
its possessor, exposed to a suitable
process of training, may be trusted to acquire
the largest body of knowledge and the highest
skill at ratiocination to which <i>Homo sapiens</i> is
adapted. Of another we may say with the same
confidence that its abilities are sharply limited—that
no conceivable training can move it beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
a certain point. In other words, men differ
inside their heads as they differ outside.
There are men who are naturally intelligent and
can learn, and there are men who are naturally
stupid and cannot.</p>

<p>Here, of course, I flirt with the so-called intelligence
tests, and so bring down upon my
head that acrid bile which they have set to flowing.
My plea in avoidance is that I have surely
done my share of damning them: they aroused,
when they were first heard of, my most brutish
passions, for pedagogues had them in hand.
But I can only say that time and experience have
won me to them, for the evidence in favor of
them slowly piles up, pedagogues or no pedagogues.
In other words, they actually work.
What they teach is borne out by immense accumulations
of empiric corroboration. It is
safe, nine times out of ten, to give them credence,
and so it seems to me to be safe to generalize
from them. Is it only a coincidence that their
most frantic critics are the Liberals, which is to
say, the only surviving honest believers in democracy?
I think not. These Liberals, whatever
their defects otherwise, are themselves capable
of learning, and so they quickly mastered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
the fact that MM. Simon and Binet offered the
most dangerous menace to their vapourings ever
heard of since the collapse of the Holy Alliance.
Their dudgeon followed. In two ways the tests
give aid and comfort to their enemies. First,
they provide a more or less scientific means of
demonstrating the difference in natural intelligence
between man and man—a difference noted
ages ago by common observation, and held to be
real by all men save democrats, at all times and
everywhere. Second, they provide a rational
scale for measuring it and a rational explanation
of it. Intelligence is reduced to levels, and so
given a reasonable precision of meaning. An
intelligent man is one who is capable of taking
in knowledge until the natural limits of the species
are reached. A stupid man is one whose
progress is arrested at some specific time and
place before then. There thus appears in psychology—and
the next instant in politics—the
concept of the unteachable. Some men can
learn almost indefinitely; their capacity goes on
increasing until their bodies begin to wear out.
Others stop in childhood, even in infancy. They
reach, say, the mental age of ten or twelve, and
then they develop no more. Physically, they become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
men, and sprout beards, political delusions,
and the desire to propagate their kind.
But mentally they remain on the level of school-boys.</p>

<p>The fact here is challenged sharply by the
democrats aforesaid, but certainly not with evidence.
Their objection to it is rather of a metaphysical
character, and involves gratuitous,
transcendental assumptions as to what ought and
what ought not to be true. They echo also, of
course, the caveats of other and less romantic
critics, some of them very ingenious; but
always, when hard pressed, they fall back pathetically
upon the argument that believing such
things would be in contempt of the dignity of
man, made in God’s image. Is this argument
sound? Is it, indeed, new? I seem to have
heard it long ago, from the gentlemen of the
sacred faculty. Don’t they defend the rubbish
of Genesis on the theory that rejecting it
would leave the rabble without faith, and that
without faith it would be one with the brutes, and
very unhappy, and, what is worse, immoral? I
leave such contentions to the frequenters of
Little Bethel, and pause only to observe that if
the progress of the human race had depended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
upon them we’d all believe in witches, ectoplasms
and madstones to-day. Democracy, alas, is
also a form of theology, and shows all the immemorial
stigmata. Confronted by uncomfortable
facts, it invariably tries to dispose of
them by appeals to the highest sentiments of
the human heart. An anti-democrat is not
merely mistaken; he is also wicked, and the
more plausible he is the more wicked he becomes.
As I have said, the earliest of modern
democrats were full of Christian juices. Their
successors never get very far from Genesis <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, 27.
They are Fundamentalists by instinct, however
much they may pretend to a mellow scepticism.</p>

<p>One undoubted fact gives them a certain left-handed
support, though they are far too discreet
to make use of it. I allude to the fact that man
on the lower levels, though he quickly reaches
the limit of his capacity for taking in actual
knowledge, remains capable for a long time
thereafter of absorbing delusions. What is true
daunts him, but what is <em>not</em> true finds lodgment
in his cranium with so little resistance that there
is only a trifling emission of heat. I shall go
back to this singular and beautiful phenomenon
later on. It lies at the heart of what is called religion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and at the heart of all democratic politics
no less. The thinking of what Charles Richet
calls <i>Homo stultus</i> is almost entirely in terms
of palpable nonsense. He has a dreadful capacity
for embracing and cherishing impostures.
His history since the first records is a history of
successive victimizations—by priests, by politicians,
by all sorts and conditions of quacks.
His heroes are always frauds. In all ages he
has hated bitterly the men who were labouring
most honestly and effectively for the progress of
the race. What such men teach is beyond his
grasp. He believes in consequence that it is
unsound, immoral and of the devil.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_15">3.</h3>

<p><i>The New Psychology</i></p>

<p>The concept of arrested development has
caused an upheaval in psychology, and reduced
the arduous introspections of the old-time psychologists
to a series of ingenious but unimportant
fancies. Men are <em>not</em> alike, and very
little can be learned about the mental processes
of a congressman, an ice-wagon driver or a
cinema actor by studying the mental processes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
a genuinely superior man. The difference is not
only qualitative; it is also, in important ways,
quantitative. One thus sees the world as a vast
field of greased poles, flying gaudy and seductive
flags. Up each a human soul goes shinning,
painfully and with many a slip. Some climb
eventually to the high levels; a few scale the
dizziest heights. But the great majority never
get very far from the ground. There they
struggle for a while, and then give it up. The
effort is too much for them; it doesn’t seem to
be worth its agonies. Golf is easier; so is joining
Rotary; so is Fundamentalism; so is osteopathy;
so is Americanism.</p>

<p>In an aristocratic society government is a function
of those who have got relatively far up the
poles, either by their own prowess or by starting
from the shoulders of their fathers—which is to
say, either by God’s grace or by God’s grace.
In a democratic society it is the function of all,
and hence mainly of those who have got only a
few spans from the ground. Their eyes, to be
sure, are still thrown toward the stars. They
contemplate, now bitterly, now admiringly, the
backsides of those who are above them. They
are bitter when they sense anything rationally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
describable as actual superiority; they admire
when what they see is fraud. Bitterness and
admiration, interacting, form a complex of prejudices
which tends to cast itself into more or less
stable forms. Fresh delusions, of course, enter
into it from time to time, usually on waves of
frantic emotion, but it keeps its main outlines.
This complex of prejudices is what is known,
under democracy, as public opinion. It is the
glory of democratic states.</p>

<p>Its content is best studied by a process of
analysis—that is, by turning from the complex
whole to the simpler parts. What does the mob
think? It thinks, obviously, what its individual
members think. And what is that? It is, in
brief, what somewhat sharp-nosed and unpleasant
children think. The mob, being composed,
in the overwhelming main, of men and women
who have not got beyond the ideas and emotions
of childhood, hovers, in mental age, around the
time of puberty, and chiefly below it. If we
would get at its thoughts and feelings we must
look for light to the thoughts and feelings of
adolescents. The old-time introspective psychology
offered little help here. It concerned
itself almost exclusively with the mental processes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the more reflective, and hence the superior
sort of adults; it fell into the disastrous
fallacy of viewing a child as simply a little man.
Just as modern medicine, by rejecting a similar
fallacy on the physical plane, has set up the
science and art of pediatrics, so the new behaviourist
psychology has given a new dignity and
autonomy to the study of the child mind. The
first steps were very difficult. The behaviourists
not only had to invent an entirely new technique,
like the pediatricians before them; they also had
to meet the furious opposition of the orthodox
psychologists, whose moony speculations they
laughed at and whose authority they derided.
But they persisted, and the problems before them
turned out, in the end, to be relatively simple,
and by no means difficult to solve. By observing
attentively what was before everyone’s nose
they quickly developed facts which left the orthodox
psychologists in an untenable and absurd
position. One by one, the old psychological
categories went overboard, and with them a vast
mass of vague and meaningless psychological
terminology.</p>

<p>On the cleared ground remained a massive
discovery: that the earliest and most profound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
of human emotions is fear. Man comes into
the world weak and naked, and almost as devoid
of intelligence as an oyster, but he brings with
him a highly complex and sensitive susceptibility
to fear. He can tremble and cry out in the first
hours of his life—nay, in the first minute.
Make a loud noise behind an infant just born,
and it will shake like a Sunday-school superintendent
taken in adultery. Take away its support—that
is, make it believe that it is falling—and
it will send up such a whoop as comes
from yokels when the travelling tooth-puller has
at them. These fears, by their character, suggest
that they have a phylogenic origin—that is,
that they represent inherited race experience, out
of the deep darkness and abysm of time. Dr.
John B. Watson, the head of the behaviourist
school, relates them to the daily hazards of arboreal
man—the dangers presented by breaking
tree branches. The ape-man learned to fear the
sudden, calamitous plunge, and he learned to
fear, too, the warning crack. One need not follow
Dr. Watson so far; there is no proof, indeed,
that man was ever arboreal. But it must
be obvious that this emotion of fear is immensely
deep-seated—that it is instinctive if anything is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
instinctive. And all the evidence indicates that
every other emotion is subordinate to it. None
other shows itself so soon, and none other enters
so powerfully into the first functioning of the
infant mind. And to the primeval and yet profoundly
rational fears that it brings into the
world it quickly adds others that depart farther
and farther from rationality. It begins to fear
ideas as well as things, strange men as well as
hostile nature. It picks up dreads and trepidations
from its mother, from its nurse, from other
children. At the age of three years, as Dr.
Watson shows, its mental baggage is often little
more than a vast mass of such things. It has
anxieties, horrors, even superstitions. And as it
increases in years it adds constantly to the stock.</p>

<p>The process of education is largely a process
of getting rid of such fears. It rehearses, after a
fashion, the upward struggle of man. The ideal
educated man is simply one who has put away as
foolish the immemorial fears of the race—of
strange men and strange ideas, of the powers
and principalities of the air. He is sure of himself
in the world; no dread of the dark rides
him; he is serene. To produce such men is the
central aim of every rational system of education;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
even under democracy it is one of the aims,
though perhaps only a subordinate one. What
brings it to futility is simply the fact that the vast
majority of men are congenitally incapable of
any such intellectual progress. They cannot
take in new ideas, and they cannot get rid of
old fears. They lack the logical sense; they are
unable to reason from a set of facts before them,
free from emotional distraction. But they also
lack something more fundamental: they are incompetent
to take in the bald facts themselves.
Here I point to the observations of Dr. Eleanor
R. Wembridge, a practical psychologist of great
shrewdness. Her contribution is the discovery
that the lower orders of men, though they seem
superficially to use articulate speech and thus to
deal in ideas, are actually but little more accomplished
in that way than so many trained animals.
Words, save the most elemental, convey
nothing to them. Their minds cannot grasp even
the simplest abstractions; all their thinking is
done on the level of a few primitive appetites
and emotions. It is thus a sheer impossibility
to educate them, as much so as it would be if
they were devoid of the five senses. The school-marm
who has at them wastes her time shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
up a rain-spout. They are imitative, as many of
the lower animals are imitative, and so they
sometimes deceive her into believing that her expositions
and exhortations have gone home, but
a scientific examination quickly reveals that they
have taken in almost nothing. Thus ideas leave
them unscathed; they are responsive only to emotions,
and their emotions are all elemental—the
emotions, indeed, of tabby-cats rather than
of men.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_22">4.</h3>

<p><i>Politics Under Democracy</i></p>

<p>Fear remains the chiefest of them. The
demagogues, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the professors of mob psychology,
who flourish in democratic states are
well aware of the fact, and make it the corner-stone
of their exact and puissant science. Politics
under democracy consists almost wholly of
the discovery, chase and scotching of bugaboos.
The statesman becomes, in the last analysis, a
mere witch-hunter, a glorified smeller and
snooper, eternally chanting “Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum!”
It has been so in the United States since the earliest
days. The whole history of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
has been a history of melodramatic pursuits of
horrendous monsters, most of them imaginary:
the red-coats, the Hessians, the monocrats, again
the red-coats, the Bank, the Catholics, Simon
Legree, the Slave Power, Jeff Davis, Mormonism,
Wall Street, the rum demon, John Bull, the
hell hounds of plutocracy, the trusts, General
Weyler, Pancho Villa, German spies, hyphenates,
the Kaiser, Bolshevism. The list might be
lengthened indefinitely; a complete chronicle of
the Republic could be written in terms of it, and
without omitting a single important episode. It
was long ago observed that the plain people, under
democracy, never vote <em>for</em> anything, but always
<em>against</em> something. The fact explains, in
large measure, the tendency of democratic states
to pass over statesmen of genuine imagination
and sound ability in favour of colourless mediocrities.
The former are shining marks, and so
it is easy for demagogues to bring them down;
the latter are preferred because it is impossible
to fear them. The demagogue himself, when
he grows ambitious and tries to posture as a
statesman, usually comes ignominiously to grief,
as the cases of Bryan, Roosevelt and Wilson
dramatically demonstrate. If Bryan had confined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
himself, in 1896, to the chase of the bugaboo
of plutocracy, it is very probable that he
would have been elected. But he committed the
incredible folly of throwing most of his energies
into advocating a so-called constructive program,
and it was thus easy for his opponents to
alarm the mob against him. That program
had the capital defect of being highly technical,
and hence almost wholly unintelligible to all
save a small minority; so it took on a sinister
look, and caused a shiver to go down the democratic
spine. It was his cross-of-gold speech
that nominated him; it was his cow State political
economy that ruined him. Bryan was a highly
unintelligent man, a true son of the mob, and
thus never learned anything by experience. In
his last days he discovered a new issue in
the evolutionary hypothesis. It was beyond
the comprehension of the mob, and hence well
adapted to arousing its fears. But he allowed
his foes to take the offensive out of his hands,
and in the last scene of all he himself was the
pursued, and the tide of the battle was running
so heavily against him that even the hinds at
Dayton, Tenn., were laughing at him.</p>

<p>Government under democracy is thus government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
by orgy, almost by orgasm. Its processes
are most beautifully displayed at times when
they stand most naked—for example, in war
days. The history of the American share in the
World War is simply a record of conflicting
fears, more than once amounting to frenzies.
The mob, at the start of the uproar, showed a
classical reaction: it was eager only to keep out
of danger. The most popular song, in the
United States, in 1915, was “I Didn’t Raise My
Boy to be a Soldier.” In 1916, on his fraudulent
promise to preserve that boy from harm,
Wilson was reëlected. There then followed
some difficult manœuvres—but perhaps not so
difficult, after all, to skilful demagogues. The
problem was to substitute a new and worse fear
for the one that prevailed—a new fear so powerful
that it would reconcile the mob to the thought
of entering the war. The business was undertaken
resolutely on the morning after election
day. Thereafter, for three months, every official
agency lent a hand. No ship went down to a
submarine’s torpedo anywhere on the seven seas
that the State Department did not report that
American citizens—nay, American infants in
their mothers’ arms—were aboard. Diplomatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
note followed diplomatic note, each new
one surpassing all its predecessors in moral indignation.
The Department of Justice ascribed
all fires, floods and industrial accidents to German
agents. The newspapers were filled with
dreadful surmises, many of them officially inspired,
about the probable effects upon the
United States of the prospective German victory.
It was obvious to everyone, even to the mob, that
a victorious Germany would unquestionably demand
an accounting for the United States’ gross
violations of neutrality. Thus a choice of fears
was set up. The first was a fear of a Germany
heavily beset, but making alarming progress
against her foes. The second was a fear of a
Germany delivered from them, and thirsting for
revenge on a false and venal friend. The second
fear soon engulfed the first. By the time
February came the mob was reconciled to entering
the war—reconciled, but surely not eager.</p>

<p>There remained the problem of converting reluctant
acquiescence into enthusiasm. It was
solved, as always, by manufacturing new fears.
The history of the process remains to be written
by competent hands: it will be a contribution to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the literature of mob psychology of the highest
importance. But the main outlines are familiar
enough. The whole power of the government
was concentrated upon throwing the plain people
into a panic. All sense was heaved overboard,
and there ensued a chase of bugaboos on
a truly epic scale. Nothing like it had ever
been seen in the world before, for no democratic
state as populous as the United States had ever
gone to war before. I pass over the details, and
pause only to recall the fact that the American
people, by the end of 1917, were in such terror
that they lived in what was substantially a state
of siege, though the foe was 3000 miles away
and obviously unable to do them any damage.
It was only the draft, I believe, that gave them
sufficient courage to attempt actual hostilities.
That ingenious device, by relieving the overwhelming
majority of them of any obligation to
take up arms, made them bold. Before it was
adopted they were heavily in favour of contributing
only munitions and money to the cause of
democracy, with perhaps a few divisions of
Regulars added for the moral effect. But once
it became apparent that a given individual, John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Doe, would not have to serve, he, John Doe, developed
an altruistic eagerness for a frontal attack
in force. For every Richard Roe in the
conscript camps there were a dozen John Does
thus safely at home, with wages high and the
show growing enjoyable. So an heroic mood
came upon the people, and their fear was
concealed by a truculent front. But not from
students of mob psychology.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_28">5.</h3>

<p><i>The Rôle of the Hormones</i></p>

<p>Two other emotions are observed in the raw
human being, fresh from God’s hands: one is
rage, and the other is what, for want of a more
accurate name, may be called love. This love,
of course, is something quite different from the
thing that poets sing. It is a great deal more
earthly, and perhaps a great deal more honest.
It manifests itself typically in a delight in being
tickled; its psychic overtones take the form of
being amiable. The child that is capable of it
in the fullest measure is the one that coos loudest
when its mother pats and strokes it, and tucks
it into bed. In these sad days, when every flapper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
has read Freud and ponders on the libido,
there is no need, I take it, for me to explain that
such delights have their seats chiefly in erogenous
zones, and have more to do with the hormones
than with the soul. Here the new child psychology
confirms the observations of the Freudians,
and reinforces their allegation that even
the most tender and innocent infant may be
worthy of suspicion. Dr. Watson says that the
dreadful phenomenon of tumescence in the male
can occur at birth—a satirical fact of the first
calibre, if a fact. It concerns us here only because
the incurable infantilism of the inferior
man brings him to manhood with his emotions in
this department substantially what they were
when he yielded himself to auto-erotic exercises
in the cradle.</p>

<p>But there is yet a difference, and it is important.
In character his amorous fancies are the
same; in intensity they are immensely exaggerated.
His brain, in the first years of his second
decade, ceases to develop, but simultaneously his
glands begin to unfold gloriously, and presently
they dominate his whole organism. In his middle
teens, he is no more than a vast geyser of
hormones. The sweet passion of love, in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
years, is to him precisely what it is to a Tom cat.
If he is of the bucolic variety of <i>Homo stultus</i>
he has his will of his neighbour’s daughter, and
there begins a race between the village pastor
and the village <i lang="fr">sage-femme</i>. If he is of the
urban proletariat, he finds the outer world more
inhospitable to the inner urge, for there are no
dark lanes in the cities and no moonlight nights,
but the urge itself remains irresistible and so
in some way or other, vicariously or in harsh
physiological terms, he yields himself to it, and
loses his immortal soul.</p>

<p>Later on the thing grows more subtle and even
more refined. His vast capacity for illusion,
his powerful thirst for the not true, embellishes
his anthropoid appetite without diminishing it,
and he begins to toy with sentiment, even with a
sort of poetry. If you want to discover the content
of that poetry go look at any movie, or listen
to any popular song. At its loftiest, it is never
far from the poetry of a rooster in a barnyard.
Love, to the inferior man, remains almost wholly
a physical matter. The heroine he most admires
is the one who offers the grossest sexual provocation;
the hero who makes his wife roll her eyes
is a perambulating phallus. The eminent psychologists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
who conduct tabloid newspapers make
this fact the corner-stone of their metaphysical
system. Their ideal piece of news is one in
which nothing is left to the imagination that can
be wormed through the mails. Their readers
want no sublimation and no symbolism.</p>

<p>Love, as Freud explains, has many meanings.
It runs from the erotic to the philanthropic.
But in all departments and on all planes the inferior
man reduces it to terms of his own elemental
yearnings. Of all his stupidities there
is none more stupid than that which makes it
impossible for him to see beyond them, even as
an act of the imagination. He simply cannot
formulate the concept of a good that is not his
own good. The fact explains his immemorial
heat against heretics, sacred and secular. His
first thought and his last thought, contemplating
them, is to stand them up against a wall, and
have at them with musketry. Go back into history
as far as you please, and you will find no
record that he has ever opened his mouth for
fairness, for justice, for decency between man
and man. Such concepts, like the concepts of
honour and of liberty, are eternally beyond him,
and belong only to his superiors. The slaughters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
in the Roman arena delighted him; he applauded
Torquemada; only yesterday he was
marching against radicals—<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, idiots who lamented
his exploitation and sought to end it—with
the American Legion. His natural cowardice,
of course, moves him powerfully in such
situations: his congenital fear is easily translated
into cruelty. But something must also be said
for his mere incapacity to project himself into
the place of the other, his deficiency in imagination.
Are the poor charitable? Then it is only
to the poor. When their betters stand before
them, asking for something that they may withhold—when
they are thus confronted, though the
thing asked for be only fair dealing, elemental
justice, common decency, they are wolves.</p>

<p>In a previous work I have adverted to the appalling
development of this wolfishness among
peasants. They may be safely assumed, I believe,
to represent the lowest caste among civilized men.
They are the closest, both in their
avocations and in their mental processes, to primeval
man. One may think of them as the sediment
remaining in the filter after the stream of
progress has gone through. Even the city proletariat
is appreciably superior, if only because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
it embraces those more intelligent yokels who
have had the wit to escape from the dreadful
drudgery of the dunghill. Well, give a glance
at the theology and politics prevailing on the
land. The former, in all countries and all ages,
has kept contact with the primitive animism of
savages: it bristles everywhere with demons,
witches and ghosts. In its public aspect it is as
intolerant of heresy as Thibetan lamaism. The
yokel not only believes that all heretics are
doomed to be roasted in hell through all eternity;
he also holds that they should be harassed
as much as possible on this earth. The anti-evolution
laws of the South afford an instructive
glimpse into the peasant mind. They are based
frankly upon the theory that every man who dissents
from the barnyard theology is a scoundrel,
and devoid of civil rights. That theory was put
very plainly by the peasant attorney-general during
the celebrated Scopes trial, to the visible
satisfaction of the peasant judge.</p>

<p>In politics the virtuous clod-hopper, again
speaking for inferior man, voices notions of precisely
the same sort. The whole process of government,
as he views it, is simply a process of
promoting his private advantage. He can imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
no good save his own good. When his
affairs are prospering—which is to say, when
the needs of the city man are acute, and the
latter is thus at his mercy—he rams his advantage
home with relentless ferocity. For him to
show any altruism in such a situation, or even
any common humanity, would be so strange as
to appear fabulous. But when things are running
against him he believes that the city man
should be taxed to make up his losses: this is the
alpha and omega of all the brummagem progressivism
that emanates from the farm. That
“progressivism,” in the hands of political
mountebanks, is swathed in the trappings of
Service, but at the heart of it there is nothing but
bald self-seeking. The yokel hates everyone
who is not a yokel—and is afraid of everyone.
He is democratic man in the altogether. He is
the glory and bulwark of all democratic states.
The city proletarian may be flustered and run
amok by ideas—ideas without any sense, true
enough, but still ideas. The yokel has room in
his head for only one. That is the idea that
God regards him fondly, and has a high respect
for him—that all other men are out of favour in
heaven and abandoned to the devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_35">6.</h3>

<p><i>Envy As a Philosophy</i></p>

<p>But under this pretension to superiority, of
course, there lies an uncomfortable realization
of actual inferiority. The peasant hates; <i>ergo</i>,
he envies—and “<span lang="fr">l’envie</span>,” as Heine said to
Philarète Chasles, “<span lang="fr">est une infériorité qui
s’avoue</span>.” The disdain that goes with genuine
superiority is something quite different; there is
no sign of it in him. He is so far from it, indeed,
that he can imagine no higher delights than
such as proceed from acts which, when performed
by the hated city man, he denounces as
crimes, and tries to put down by law. It is the
cabaret that makes a Prohibitionist of him, not
the drunkard in the gutter. Doomed himself to
drink only crude and unpalatable stimulants,
incompetently made and productive of depressing
malaises, and forced to get them down in
solitary swinishness behind the door, he naturally
longs for the varieties that have a more
delicate and romantic smack, and are ingested in
gay society and to the music of harps and sackbuts.
That longing is vain. There are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
cabarets in the village, but only sordid speak-easies,
selling raw spirits out of filthy jugs.
Drinking cider in the barn is so lonely as to be
a sort of onanism. Where is the music?
Where are the whirling spangles, the brilliant
lights? Where is the swooning, suffocating
scent of lilies-of-the-valley, Jockey Club?
Where, above all, are the lost and fascinating
females, so thrillingly described by the visiting
evangelist? The yokel peeks through a crack
in the barn-door and glimpses his slatternly
wife laboriously rounding up strayed pigs: to
ask her in for a friendly bumper would be as
appalling as asking in the cow. So he gets
down his unappetizing dram, feels along his
glabella for the beginning headache, and resumes
his melancholy heaving of manure—a
Prohibitionist by conscience, doubly-riveted and
immovable.</p>

<p>In all his politics this envy is manifest. He
hates the plutocrats of the cities, not only because
they best him in the struggle for money, but also
because they spend their gains in debaucheries
that are beyond him. Such yellow-backs as
“Night Life in Chicago” have done more, I believe,
to propagate “idealism” in the corn-and-hog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
belt than all the eloquence of the Pfeffers
and Bryans. The yokels, reading them in secret,
leave them full of a passionate conviction
that such Babylonish revels must be put down, if
Christianity is to survive—that it is obviously
against the will of God that a Chicago stock-broker
should have five wives and fifty concubines,
and an Iowa swineherd but one—and that
one a strictly Christian woman, even at the purple
moments when wits and principles tend naturally
to scatter. In the cities, as everyone
knows, women move toward antinomianism: it
is a scandal throughout Christendom. Their
souls, I daresay, are imperilled thereby, but certainly
no one argues that it makes them less
charming—least of all the husbandman behind
his remote plough, tortured by ruby reflections of
the carnalities at Atlantic City and Miami. On
the land, however, that movement has but little
genuine force, despite a general apeing of its
externals. The female young may bob their
hair, but they do not reject divine revelation.
I am told by experts that it is still a sort of marvel,
as it was in the youth of Abraham Lincoln,
to find a farm-wife who has definitely renounced
the theology of the local pastors. The fact has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
obvious moral—and, by an easy step, political—consequences.
There are about six and a half
million farmers in the United States. Keep in
mind the fact that at least six millions of them
are forced to live in unmitigated monogamy
with wives whose dominant yearning is to save
the heathen hordes in India from hell fire, and
you will begin to get some grasp of the motives
behind such statutes as the celebrated Mann
Act. The sea-sick passenger on the ocean liner
detests the “good sailor” who stalks past him a
hundred times a day, obscenely smoking large,
greasy, gold-banded cigars. In precisely the
same way democratic man hates the fellow who
is having a better time of it in this world. Such,
indeed, is the origin of democracy. And such is
the origin of its twin, Puritanism.</p>

<p>The city proletarian, of course, is a cut above
the hind, if only because his natural envy of his
betters is mitigated and mellowed by <i lang="la">panem et
circenses</i>. His life may be swinish, but it is
seldom dull. In good times there is actual
money in his hand, and immense and complicated
organizations offer him gaudy entertainment
in return for it. In bad times his basic
wants are met out of the community funds, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
he is even kept in certain luxuries, necessary to
his contentment. The immense development of
public charity in the cities of the United States
has yet to find adequate analysis and record.
Nothing quite like it was ever known in past ages,
nor is it paralleled in any other country to-day.
What lies under it, I daresay, is simply the fact
that the plutocracy of the Republic, having had
more experience with democracy than the plutocracy
anywhere else, has attained to a higher
skill in dealing with the proletarian. He is
never dangerous so long as his belly is filled and
his eyes kept a-pop; and in this great land, by
Divine Providence, there is always enough surplus
wealth, even in the worst times, to finance
that filling and popping. The plethora of
means has bred a large class of experts, professionally
devoted to the business. They swarm
in all the American cities, and when genuine
wants fail them they invent artificial wants.
This enterprise in the third theological virtue has
gone to great lengths. The proletarian, in his
office as father, is now reduced by it to the simple
biological function of a boar in a barnyard.
From the moment the fertilized ovum attaches
itself to the <i lang="la">decidua serotina</i> he is free to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
himself whole-heartedly to politics, drink and
the radio. There is elaborate machinery for instructing
the partner of his ecstasies in the whole
art and mystery of maternity, and all the accompanying
expenses are provided for. Obstetricians
of the highest eminence stand ready to
examine her and counsel her; gynecologists are
at hand to perform any necessary operations;
trained nurses call at her home, supply and prepare
her diet, warn her against a too animated
social life, hand her instructive literature, and
entertain her with anecdotes suitable to her
condition. If she is too clumsy or too lazy to
fashion a layette, or can’t afford the materials, it
is provided free of charge. And when she comes
to term at last she is taken into a steam-heated
hospital, boarded without cost, and delivered in
a brilliant, aseptic, and, in so far as money can
make it so, painless manner.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. Once she has become a mother
her benefits only increase. If she wants to get
rid of her child it is taken off her hands, and
eager propagandists instruct her in the science
of avoiding another. If she chooses to keep it
there is elaborate machinery for reducing the
care and cost of it to nothing. Visiting nurses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of a dozen different varieties stand ready to assume
the burdens of washing it, dosing it with
purges, and measuring out its victuals. Milk is
supplied free—and not simply common cow’s
milk, but cow’s milk modified according to the
subtlest formulæ of eminent pediatricians. Ice
is thrown in as a matter of course. Medicines
are free at the neighbourhood dispensary. If the
mother, recovering her figure, wishes to go shopping,
she may park her baby at a <em>crèche</em>, and,
on the plea that she is employed as a charwoman,
leave it there all day. Once it can toddle the
kindergarten yawns for it, and in holiday time
the public playground, each officered by learned
experts. The public school follows, and with
it a host of new benefits. Dentists are in attendance
to plug and pull the youngster’s
teeth at the public charge. Oculists fit it with
horn-rimmed spectacles. It is deloused. Free
lunches sustain it. Its books cost nothing. It is
taught not only the three R’s, but also raffiawork,
bookkeeping, basketball, salesmanship,
the new dances, and parliamentary law. It
learns the causes of the late war and the fallacies
of Socialism.</p>

<p>The rest you know as well as I do. The proletarian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
is so artfully relieved of the elemental
gnawings which constantly terrorize the peasant
and so steadily distracted from all sober thinking
that his natural envy of his betters is sublimated
into a sort of boozy contentment, like that
of a hog in a comfortable sty. He escapes boredom,
and with it, brooding. The political imbecilities
which pile up in great waves from the
prairies break upon the hard rock of his urban
cynicism like rollers upon the strand. His pastors
have but a slight hold upon him, and so cannot
stir him up to the frantic hatreds which move
the yokel. Even his wife emancipates herself
from the ancient demonology of the race: his
typical complaint against her is not that she is
made anaphrodisiacal by Christian endeavour
but that she is too worldly and extravagant, and
spreads her charms too boldly. The rustic,
alone upon his dung-hill, has time to nurse his
grievances; the city moron is diverted from
them by the shows that surround him. There
was a time when yellow journalism promised to
prod him to dudgeon, and even to send him
yelling to the barricades. But the plutocracy
has deftly drawn its fangs, and in its place are
the harmless tabloids. They ease his envy by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
giving him a vicarious share in the debaucheries
of his economic superiors. He is himself,
of course, unable to roar about the country in
a high-powered car, accompanied by a beautiful
coloured girl of large gifts for the art of
love, but when he reads of the scions of old
Knickerbocker families doing it he somehow
gets a touch of the thrill. It flatters him to think
that he lives in a community in which such levantine
joys are rife. Thus his envy is obscured by
civic pride, by connoisseurship, and by a simple
animal delight in good shows. By the time
the tale reaches the yokel it is reduced to its
immoral elements, and so makes him smell brimstone.
But the city proletarian hears the frou-frou
of perfumed skirts.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_43">7.</h3>

<p><i>Liberty and Democratic Man</i></p>

<p>Under the festive surface, of course, envy
remains: the proletarian is still a democrat.
The fact shows itself grimly whenever the supply
of <i lang="la">panem et circenses</i> falls off sharply, and the
harsh realities make themselves felt. All the
revolutions in history have been started by hungry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
city mobs. The fact is, indeed, so plain that
it has attracted the notice even of historians, and
some of them deduce from it the doctrine that
city life breeds a love of liberty. It may be so,
but certainly that love is not visible in the lower
orders. I can think of no city revolution that
actually had liberty for its object, in any rational
sense. The ideas of freedom that prevail in
the world to-day were first formulated by country
gentlemen, aided and abetted by poets and
philosophers, with occasional help from an eccentric
king. One of the most valid of them—that
of free speech—was actually given its first
support in law by the most absolute monarch of
modern times, to wit, Frederick the Great.
When the city mob fights it is not for liberty, but
for ham and cabbage. When it wins, its first
act is to destroy every form of freedom that is
not directed wholly to that end. And its second
is to butcher all professional libertarians.
If Thomas Jefferson had been living in Paris in
1793 he would have made an even narrower escape
from the guillotine than Thomas Paine
made.</p>

<p>The fact is that liberty, in any true sense, is
a concept that lies quite beyond the reach of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the inferior man’s mind. He can imagine and
even esteem, in his way, certain false forms of
liberty—for example, the right to choose between
two political mountebanks, and to yell for
the more obviously dishonest—but the reality
is incomprehensible to him. And no wonder,
for genuine liberty demands of its votaries a
quality he lacks completely, and that is courage.
The man who loves it must be willing to fight
for it; blood, said Jefferson, is its natural
manure. More, he must be able to <em>endure</em> it—an
even more arduous business. Liberty means
self-reliance, it means resolution, it means enterprise,
it means the capacity for doing without.
The free man is one who has won a small and
precarious territory from the great mob of his
inferiors, and is prepared and ready to defend
it and make it support him. All around him
are enemies, and where he stands there is
no friend. He can hope for little help from other
men of his own kind, for they have battles of
their own to fight. He has made of himself a
sort of god in his little world, and he must face
the responsibilities of a god, and the dreadful
loneliness. Has <i>Homo boobiens</i> any talent for
this magnificent self-reliance? He has the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
talent for it that he has for writing symphonies
in the manner of Ludwig van Beethoven, no less
and no more. That is to say, he has no talent
whatsoever, nor even any understanding that such
a talent exists. Liberty is unfathomable to him.
He can no more comprehend it than he can comprehend
honour. What he mistakes for it, nine
times out of ten, is simply the banal right to
empty hallelujahs upon his oppressors. He is
an ox whose last proud, defiant gesture is to
lick the butcher behind the ear.</p>

<p>“The vast majority of persons of our race,”
said Sir Francis Galton, “have a natural tendency
to shrink from the responsibility of standing
and acting alone.” It is a pity that the
great pioneer of studies in heredity did not go
beyond the fact to its obvious causes: they were
exactly in his line. What ails “the vast majority
of persons of our race” is simply the fact that,
to their kind, even such mild and narrow liberties
as they can appreciate are very recent acquisitions.
It is barely a century and a half—a
scant five generations—since four-fifths of the
people of the world, white and black alike, were
slaves, in reality if not in name. I could fill
this book with evidence, indubitable and overwhelming.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
There are whole libraries upon the
subject. Turn to any treatise on the causes of
the French Revolution, and you will find the
French peasant of 1780 but little removed, in
legal rights and daily tasks, from the <i>fellahin</i>
who built Cheops’ pyramid. Consult any work
on the rise of the Industrial System in England,
and you will find the towns of that great liberty-loving
land filled, in the same year, with a half-starved
and anthropoid proletariat, and the
countryside swarming with a dispossessed and
despairing peasantry. Open any school-book of
American history, and you will see Germans
sold like cattle by their masters. If you thirst
for more, keep on: the tale was precisely the
same in Italy, in Spain, in Russia, in Scandinavia,
and in what remained of the Holy Roman
Empire. The Irish, at the close of the Eighteenth
Century, were clamped under a yoke that it took
more than a century of effort to throw off. The
Scotch, roving their bare intolerable hills, were
only two steps removed from savagery, and even
cannibalism. The Welsh, but recently delivered
from voodooism to Methodism, were being driven
into their own coal-mines. There was no liberty
anywhere in Europe, even in name, until 1789,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and there was little in fact until 1848. And
in America? Again I summon the historians,
some of whom begin to grow honest. America
was settled largely by slaves, some escaped
but others transported in bondage. The Revolution
was imposed upon them by their betters,
chiefly, in New England, commercial gents in
search of greater profits, and in the South,
country gentlemen ambitious to found a nobility
in the wilderness. Universal manhood
suffrage, the corner-stone of modern free states,
was only dreamed of until 1867, and economic
freedom was little more than a name until
years later.</p>

<p>Thus the lower orders of men, however grandiloquently
they may talk of liberty to-day, have
actually had but a short and highly deceptive
experience of it. It is not in their blood. The
grandfathers of at least half of them were slaves,
and the great-grandfathers of three-fourths, and
the great-great-grandfathers of seven-eighths, and
the great-great-great-grandfathers of practically
all. The heritage of freedom belongs to a small
minority of men, descended, whether legitimately
or by adultery, from the old lords of the soil or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
from the patricians of the free towns. It is my
contention that such a heritage is necessary in
order that the concept of liberty, with all its disturbing
and unnatural implications, may be so
much as grasped—that such ideas cannot be implanted
in the mind of man at will, but must be
bred in as all other basic ideas are bred in. The
proletarian may mouth the phrases, as he did in
Jefferson’s day, but he cannot take in the underlying
realities, as was also demonstrated
in Jefferson’s day. What his great-great-grand-children
may be capable of I am not concerned
with here; my business is with the man
himself as he now walks the world. Viewed
thus, it must be obvious that he is still incapable
of bearing the pangs of liberty. They make him
uncomfortable; they alarm him; they fill him
with a great loneliness. There is no high adventurousness
in him, but only fear. He not
only doesn’t long for liberty; he is quite unable
to stand it. What he longs for is something
wholly different, to wit, security. He needs protection.
He is afraid of getting hurt. All else
is affectation, delusion, empty words.</p>

<p>The fact, as we shall see, explains many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the most puzzling political phenomena of so-called
free states. The great masses of men,
though theoretically free, are seen to submit
supinely to oppression and exploitation of a hundred
abhorrent sorts. Have they no means of
resistance? Obviously they have. The worst
tyrant, even under democratic plutocracy, has
but one throat to slit. The moment the majority
decided to overthrow him he would be overthrown.
But the majority lacks the resolution;
it cannot imagine taking the risk. So it looks
for leaders with the necessary courage, and when
they appear it follows them slavishly, even
after their courage is discovered to be mere
buncombe and their altruism only a cloak for
more and worse oppressions. Thus it oscillates
eternally between scoundrels, or, if you would
take them at their own valuation, heroes. Politics
becomes the trade of playing upon its
natural poltroonery—of scaring it half to death,
and then proposing to save it. There is in it
no other quality of which a practical politician,
taking one day with another, may be sure.
Every theoretically free people wonders at the
slavishness of all the others. But there is no
actual difference between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>


<h3 id="toclink_51">8.</h3>

<p><i>The Effects Upon Progress</i></p>

<p>It follows that the inferior man, being a natural
slave himself, is quite unable to understand
the desire for liberty in his superiors. If he
apprehends that desire at all it is only as an appetite
for a good of which he is himself incapable.
He thus envies those who harbour it, and is
eager to put them down. Justice, in fact, is always
unpopular and in difficulties under democracy,
save perhaps that false form of so-called
social justice which is designed solely to get the
laborer more than his fair hire. The wars of
extermination that are waged against heretical
minorities never meet with any opposition on the
lower levels. The proletarian is always ready
to help destroy the rights of his fellow proletarian,
as was revealed brilliantly by the heroic
services of the American Legion in the pogrom
against Reds, just after the late war, and even
more brilliantly by the aid that the American
Federation of Labour gave to the same gallant
crusade. The city workman, oppressed by Prohibition,
mourns the loss of his beer, not the loss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of his liberty. He is ever willing to support
similar raids upon the liberty of the other fellow,
and he is not outraged when they are carried
on in gross violation of the most elemental principles
of justice and common decency. When,
in a democratic state, any protest against such
obscenities is heard at all, it comes from the
higher levels. There a few genuine believers in
liberty and justice survive, huddled upon a burning
deck. It is to be marvelled at that most
of them, on inspection, turn out to be the grandsons
of similar heretics of earlier times? I think
not. It takes quite as long to breed a libertarian
as it takes to breed a race-horse. Neither may
be expected to issue from a farm mare.</p>

<p>The whole progress of the world, even in the
direction of ameliorating the lot of the masses,
is always opposed by the masses. The notion
that their clamour brought about all the governmental
and social reforms of the last century, and
that those reforms were delayed by the superior
minority, is sheer nonsense; even Liberals begin
to reject it as absurd. Consider, for example,
the history of the American Department of
Agriculture. Whatever the corruptions and imbecilities
of this department in democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
hands, it must be plain to everyone that the net
effect of its work over many years has been a
series of immense benefits to the American
farmer—benefits that have at once reduced his
labour and augmented his profits. Nevertheless,
it is a matter of history that the farmers of the
United States, when the Department began as a
bureau of the Patent Office in 1830, opposed it
almost unanimously, and that for years their
bitter derision kept it feeble. Without leaving
the United States one may go even farther back.
When John Adams, during his presidency, proposed
to set up a Weather Bureau, he was denounced
as an idiot and a scoundrel, as Henry
Adams has set forth in the introduction to “The
Decay of Democratic Dogma.” Examples from
our own time are so numerous and notorious that
it is needless to direct attention to them. It is
axiomatic that all measures for safeguarding
the public health are opposed by the majority,
and that getting them upon the books is mainly
a matter of deceiving and checkmating it. What
happened in Los Angeles when a vaccination
ordinance was submitted to a popular referendum
is typical of what would happen anywhere under
the same circumstances. The ordinance was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
rejected, and smallpox spread in the town. The
proletariat, alarmed, then proceeded against it
by going to Christian Scientists, osteopaths and
chiropractors. Precisely the same thing happened
in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Turn now to Germany, a country lately delivered
from despotism by the arms of altruistic
heroes. The social legislation of that country,
for more than half a century, afforded a model
to all other countries. All the workingmen’s insurance,
minimum wage, child labour and other
such acts of the United States are bald imitations
of it, and in England, before the war, the mountebank
Lloyd-George borrowed his whole bag of
tricks from it. Well, Dr. Hans Delbrück, in his
“Regierung und Volkswille,” tells us that this
legislation was fought step by step at home, and
with the utmost ferocity, by the beneficiaries of
it. When Bismarck formulated it and essayed
to get it through the Reichstag he was opposed
by every mob-master in the Empire, save only his
kept Socialist, Ferdinand Lassalle. The common
people were so heavily against him for several
years that he had to carry on the government
without the consent of the Reichstag—that
is, unconstitutionally, and at the risk of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
head. If the proletariat had been able to get
control of the German courts, as it had got control
of the Reichstag, it would have deposed him
from office and condemned him to death for high
treason. His treason consisted in trying to formulate
a code of legislation designed to restore
its old rights under the Prussian common law,
destroyed by the rise of the industrial system,
and to grant it many new and valuable benefits.</p>

<p>“Let any competently instructed person,” says
Sir Henry Maine, “turn over in his mind the
great epochs of scientific invention and social
change during the past two centuries, and consider
what would have occurred if universal suffrage
had been established at any one of them.”
Here, obviously, Sir Henry speaks of universal
suffrage that is genuinely effective—suffrage
that registers the actual will of the people accurately
and automatically. As we shall see, no
such thing exists in the world to-day, save in
limited areas. Public policies are determined
and laws are made by small minorities playing
upon the fears and imbecilities of the mob—sometimes
minorities of intelligent and honest
men, but usually minorities of rogues. But the
fact does not disturb the validity of Maine’s argument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
“Universal suffrage,” he goes on,
“would certainly have prohibited the spinning-jenny
and the power loom. It would certainly
have forbidden the threshing-machine. It would
have prevented the adoption of the Gregorian
Calendar; it would have restored the Stuarts. It
would have proscribed the Roman Catholics, with
the mob which burned Lord Mansfield’s house
and library in 1780; and it would have proscribed
the Dissenters, with the mob which burned
Dr. Priestley’s house and library in 1791.” So
much for England. What of the United States?
I point briefly to the anti-evolution acts which
now begin to adorn the statute-books of the Hookworm
Belt, all of them supported vociferously
by the lower orders. I point to the anti-vivisection
and anti-contraception statutes, to the
laws licensing osteopaths and other such frauds,
and to the multitude of acts depriving relatively
enlightened minorities of the common rights of
free assemblage and free speech. They increase
in proportion as <i lang="la">vox populi</i> is the actual voice
of the state; they run with that “more democracy”
which Liberals advocate. “Nothing in ancient
alchemy,” says Lecky, “was more irrational than
the notion that increased ignorance in the elective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
body will be converted into increased capacity
for good government in the representative body;
that the best way to improve the world and secure
rational progress is to place government
more and more under the control of the least
enlightened classes.”</p>

<p>The hostility of <i>Homo neandertalensis</i> to all
exact knowledge, even when its effect is to work
him benefits, is not hard to understand. He is
against it because it is complex, and, to his dark
mind, occult—because it puts an unbearable
burden upon his meagre capacity for taking in
ideas, and thus propels him into the realm of
the unknowable and alarming. His search is
always for short cuts, simple formulæ, revelation.
All superstitions are such short cuts,
whether they issue out of the African jungle or
out of Little Bethel. So are all political platitudes
and shibboleths. Their one aim is to make
the unintelligible simple, and even obvious. No
man who has not had a long and arduous education
in the physical sciences can understand even
the most elementary concepts of, say, pathology,
but even a hind at the plow can take in the theory
of chiropractic in two lessons. Hence the vast
popularity of chiropractic among the submerged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and of osteopathy, Christian Science, spiritualism
and all the other half rational and half
supernatural quackeries with it. They are idiotic,
like the tales displayed in the movies, but,
again like the tales displayed in the movies, they
are simple—and every man, high or low, prefers
what he can understand to what puzzles and dismays
him. The popularity of the farrago of
absurdities called Fundamentalism—and it is
popular among peasants, not only in the United
States, but everywhere in Christendom—is thus
easily understood. The cosmogonies that educated
men toy with are all inordinately complex.
To comprehend their veriest outlines requires an
immense stock of exact knowledge and a special
habit of thought, quite different in kind from the
habit of thought which suffices for listening to
the radio. It would be as vain to try to teach
these cosmogonies to peasants as it would be to
try to teach them to streptococci. But the cosmogony
set forth in the first chapter of Genesis
is so simple that a yokel can grasp it instantly.
It collides ludicrously with many of the known
facts, but he doesn’t know the known facts. It
is logically nonsensical, but to him the nonsensical,
in the sciences as in politics, has an irresistible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
fascination. So he accepts the Word with
loud hosannas, and has one more excuse for
hating his betters.</p>

<p>Turn to any other field of knowledge, and the
story remains the same. It is a tragic but inescapable
fact that most of the finest fruits of
human progress, like all of the nobler virtues
of man, are the exclusive possession of small
minorities, chiefly unpopular and disreputable.
Of the sciences, as of the fine arts, the average
human being, even in the most literate and civilized
of modern States, is as ignorant as the
horned cattle in the fields. What he knows of
histology, say, or protozoölogy, or philology,
or paleontology is precisely nothing. Such
things lie beyond his capacity for learning, and
he has no curiosity about them. The man who
has any acquaintance with them seems to him to
be a ridiculous figure, with a touch of the sinister.
Even those applied sciences which enter
intimately into his everyday existence remain
outside his comprehension and interest. Consider,
for example, chemistry and biology.
The whole life of the inferior man, including
especially his so-called thinking, is purely a
biochemical process, and exactly comparable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
what goes on in a barrel of cider, yet he knows
no more about chemistry than a cow and no more
about biology than its calf. The new physics,
in the form of the radio, saves him from the appalling
boredom of his hours of leisure, but
physics itself remains as dark to him as theosophy.
He is more ignorant of elementary
anatomy and physiology than the Egyptian
quacks of 4000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His knowledge of astronomy
is confined to a few marvels, most of which
he secretly doubts. He has never so much as
heard of ethnology, pathology or embryology.
Greek, to him, is only a jargon spoken by boot-blacks,
and Wagner is a retired baseball player.
He has never heard of Euripides, of Hippocrates,
of Aristotle, or of Plato. Or of Vesalius,
Newton, and Roger Bacon. The fine arts are
complete blanks to him. He doesn’t know what
a Doric column is, or an etching, or a fugue.
He is as ignorant of sonnets and the Gothic style
as he is of ecclesiastical politics in Abyssinia.
Homer, Virgil, Cervantes, Bach, Raphael,
Rubens, Beethoven—all such colossal names
are empty sounds to him, blowing idly down the
wind. So far as he is concerned these great
and noble men might as well have perished in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
the cradle. The stupendous beauties that they
conjured into being are nothing to him: he
sticks to the tabloids and the movies, with <i>Hot
Dog</i> or its like for Sunday afternoon. A politician
by instinct and a statesman by divine
right, he has never heard of “The Republic” or
“Leviathan.” A <i lang="de">Feinschmecker</i> of pornography,
he is unaware of Freud.</p>

<p>The Egyptian night that hedges him round is
not, perhaps, without its high uses and consolations.
Learning survives among us largely
because the mob has not got news of it. If the
notions it turns loose descended to the lowest
levels, there would be an uprising against them,
and efforts would be made to put them down by
law. In a previous treatise, adverting to this
probability, I have sounded a warning against
the fatuous effort to put the fine arts into the
common-school curriculum in the United States.
Its dangers are diminished, no doubt, by the fact
that the teachers told off to execute it are themselves
completely ignorant, but they remain dangers
none the less. The peasants of Georgia,
getting wind of the fact that grand operas were
being played in Atlanta, demanded that the State
Legislature discourage them with a tax of $1000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
a performance. In the Middle West, after the
late war, the American Legion proceeded with
clubs against fiddlers who played Beethoven and
Bach. Everywhere in America galleries of
paintings are under suspicion, and in most States
it is impossible for them to display works showing
the female figure below the clavicle. Nor
is this distrust of the fine arts confined to the
rural sections. The most active censorship of
literature, for example, is to be found in Boston.
The Methodist anthropoids of the town, supported
by the <em>Chandala</em> of the Latin rite, clerical
and lay, carry on so violent a crusade against
certain hated books, unquestionably of sound
quality, that the local booksellers fear to stock
them. Much of the best literature of the world,
indeed, is forbidden to the Bostonian, heir
though he may be to Emerson and Thoreau. If
he would read it, he must procure it by stealth
and read it behind the door, as a Kansan (imagining
that so civilized a one exists) procures
and consumes Clos Vougeot.</p>

<p>In all this there is a great deal less of yearning
for moral perfection than there is of mere
hatred of beauty. The common man, as a matter
of fact, has no yearning for moral perfection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
What ails him in that department is simply fear
of punishment, which is to say, fear of his neighbours.
He has, in safe privacy, the morals of
a variety actor. Beauty fevers and enrages him
for another and quite different reason. He cannot
comprehend it, and yet it somehow challenges
and disturbs him. If he could snore through
good music he would not object to it; the trouble
with it is that it keeps him awake. So he believes
that it ought to be put down, just as he
believes that political and economic ideas which
disturb him and yet elude him ought to be put
down. The finest art is safe from him simply
because he has no contact with it, and is thus
unaware of it. The fact, in this great Republic,
saves the bacon of Johann Sebastian Bach. His
music remains lawful because it lies outside
the cognizance of the mob, and of the abandoned
demagogues who make laws for the mob. It
has thus something of the quality of the colours
beyond violet and of the concept of honour. If,
by some abominable magic, it could be brought
within range, it would at once arouse hostility.
Its complexity would puzzle and dismay; its
lack of utilitarian purpose would affright.
Soon there would be a movement to proscribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
it, and Baptist clergymen would rove the land
denouncing it, as they now denounce the plays
of Shakespeare and the science of Darwin.
In the end some poor musician, taken playing
it in rural Tennessee, would be hailed before
a Judge Raulston, tried by a jury of morons, and
railroaded to the calaboose.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_64">9.</h3>

<p><i>The Eternal Mob</i></p>

<p>Such is man on the nether levels. Such is the
pet and glory of democratic states. Human
progress passes him by. Its aims are unintelligible
to him and its finest fruits are beyond
his reach: what reaches him is what falls from
the tree, and is shared with his four-footed brothers.
He has changed but little since the earliest
recorded time, and that change is for the worse
quite as often as it is for the better. He still
believes in ghosts, and has only shifted his belief
in witches to the political sphere. He is
still a slave to priests, and trembles before their
preposterous magic. He is lazy, improvident
and unclean. All the durable values of the
world, though his labour has entered into them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
have been created against his opposition. He
can imagine nothing beautiful and he can grasp
nothing true. Whenever he is confronted by
a choice between two ideas, the one sound and
the other not, he chooses almost infallibly, and
by a sort of pathological compulsion, the one
that is not. Behind all the great tyrants and
butchers of history he has marched with loud
hosannas, but his hand is eternally against those
who seek to liberate the spirit of the race. He
was in favour of Nero and Torquemada by instinct,
and he was against Galileo and Savonarola
by the same instinct. When a Cagliostro
dies he is ready for a Danton; from the funeral
of a Barnum he rushes to the triumph of a
Bryan. The world gets nothing from him save
his brute labour, and even that he tries to evade.
It owes nothing to him that has any solid dignity
or worth, not even democracy. In two thousand
years he has moved an inch: from the sports of
the arena to the lynching-party—and another
inch: from the obscenities of the Saturnalia to
the obscenities of the Methodist revival. So he
lives out his life in the image of Jahveh. What
is worth knowing he doesn’t know and doesn’t
want to know; what he knows is not true. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
cardinal articles of his credo are the inventions
of mountebanks; his heroes are mainly scoundrels.</p>

<p>Do I forget his central virtue—at least in
Christendom? Do I forget his simple piety, his
touching fidelity to the faith? I forget nothing:
I simply answer, What faith? Is it argued by
any rational man that the debased Christianity
cherished by the mob in all the Christian countries
of to-day has any colourable likeness to the
body of ideas preached by Christ? If so, then
let us have a better teaching of the Bible in the
public-schools. The plain fact is that this
bogus Christianity has no more relation to the
system of Christ than it has to the system of
Aristotle. It is the invention of Paul and his
attendant rabble-rousers—a body of men exactly
comparable to the corps of evangelical pastors
of to-day, which is to say, a body devoid of sense
and lamentably indifferent to common honesty.
The mob, having heard Christ, turned against
Him, and applauded His crucifixion. His theological
ideas were too logical and too plausible
for it, and his ethical ideas were enormously too
austere. What it yearned for was the old comfortable
balderdash under a new and gaudy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
name, and that is precisely what Paul offered it.
He borrowed from all the wandering dervishes
and soul-snatchers of Asia Minor, and flavoured
the stew with remnants of the Greek demonology.
The result was a code of doctrines so discordant
and so nonsensical that no two men since, examining
it at length, have ever agreed upon its precise
meaning. But Paul knew his mob: he had
been a travelling labour leader. He knew that
nonsense was its natural provender—that the unintelligible
soothed it like sweet music. He
was the <i lang="de">Stammvater</i> of all the Christian mob-masters
of to-day, terrorizing and enchanting the
mob with their insane damnations, eating their
seven fried chickens a week, passing the diligent
plate, busy among the women. Once the
early church emerged from the Roman catacombs
and began to yield to that reorganization
of society which was forced upon the ancient
world by the barbarian invasions, Paul was
thrown overboard as Methodists throw Wesley
overboard when they acquire the means and
leisure for golf, and Peter was put in his place.
Peter was a blackguard, but he was at least free
from any taint of Little Bethel. The Roman
Church, in the aristocratic feudal age, promoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
him <i lang="la">post mortem</i> to the Papacy, and then raised
him to the mystical dignity of Rock, a rank obviously
quasi-celestial. But Paul remained the
prophet of the sewers. He was to emerge centuries
later in many incarnations—Luther, Calvin,
Wesley, and so on. He remains to-day the arch-theologian
of the mob. His turgid and witless
metaphysics make Christianity bearable to men
who would be repelled by Christ’s simple and
magnificent reduction of the duties of man to the
duties of a gentleman.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_71">1.</h3>

<p><i>The Two Kinds of Democracy</i></p>

<p>The lowly Christian I have limned is not only
the glory of democratic states, but also their boss.
Sovereignty is in him, sometimes both actually
and legally, but always actually. Whatever he
wants badly enough, he can get. If he is misled
by mountebanks and swindled by scoundrels
it is only because his credulity and imbecility
cover a wider area than his simple desires. The
precise form of the government he suffers under
is of small importance. Whether it be called a
constitutional monarchy, as in England, or a
representative republic, as in France, or a pure
democracy, as in some of the cantons of Switzerland,
it is always essentially the same. There
is, first, the mob, theoretically and in fact the
ultimate judge of all ideas and the source of all
power. There is, second, the camorra of self-seeking
minorities, each seeking to inflame, delude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
and victimize it. The political process
thus becomes a mere battle of rival rogues. But
the mob remains quite free to decide between
them. It may even, under the hand of God, decide
for a minority that happens, by some miracle,
to be relatively honest and enlightened.
If, in common practice, it sticks to the thieves,
it is only because their words are words it understands
and their ideas are ideas it cherishes. It
has the power to throw them off at will, and even
at whim, and it also has the means.</p>

<p>A great deal of paper and ink has been wasted
discussing the difference between representative
government and direct democracy. The theme
is a favourite one with university pundits, and
also engages and enchants the stall-fed Rousseaus
who arise intermittently in the cow States,
and occasionally penetrate to Governors’ mansions
and the United States Senate. It is generally
held that representative government, as
practically encountered in the world, is full of
defects, some of them amounting to organic disease.
Not only does it take the initiative in law-making
out of the hands of the plain people, and
leave them only the function of referees; it also
raises certain obvious obstacles to their free exercise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
of that function. Scattered as they are,
and unorganized save in huge, unworkable
groups, they are unable, it is argued, to formulate
their virtuous desires quickly and
clearly, or to bring to the resolution of vexed
questions the full potency of their native
sagacity. Worse, they find it difficult to enforce
their decisions, even when they have decided.
Every Liberal knows this sad story,
and has shed tears telling it. The remedy he
offers almost always consists of a resort to what
he calls a purer democracy. That is to say, he
proposes to set up the recall, the initiative and
referendum, or something else of the sort, and
so convert the representative into a mere clerk or
messenger. The final determination of all important
public questions, he argues, ought to be
in the hands of the voters themselves. They
alone can muster enough wisdom for the business,
and they alone are without guile. The
cure for the evils of democracy is more democracy.</p>

<p>All this, of course, is simply rhetoric. Every
time anything of the kind is tried it fails ingloriously.
Nor is there any evidence that it
has ever succeeded elsewhere, to-day or in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
past. Certainly no competent historian believes
that the citizens assembled in a New England
town-meeting actually formulated <i lang="fr">en masse</i> the
transcendental and immortal measures that they
adopted, nor even that they contributed anything
of value to the discussion thereof. The notion
is as absurd as the parallel notion, long held
by philologues of defective powers of observation,
that the popular ballads surviving from
earlier ages were actually composed by the
folk. The ballads, in point of fact, were all
written by concrete poets, most of them not of
the folk; the folk, when they had any hand in
the business at all, simply acted as referees,
choosing which should survive. In exactly the
same way the New England town-meeting was
led and dominated by a few men of unusual
initiative and determination, some of them
genuinely superior, but most of them simply
demagogues and fanatics. The citizens in general
heard the discussion of rival ideas, and went
through the motions of deciding between them,
but there is no evidence that they ever had all
the relevant facts before them or made any effort
to unearth them, or that appeals to their reason
always, or even usually, prevailed over appeals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
to their mere prejudice and superstition. Their
appetite for logic, I venture, seldom got the better
of their fear of hell, and the Beatitudes
moved them far less powerfully than blood.
Some of the most idiotic decisions ever come
to by mortal man were made by the New England
town-meetings, and under the leadership
of monomaniacs who are still looked upon as ineffable
blossoms of the contemporary <i lang="de">Kultur</i>.</p>

<p>The truth is that the difference between representative
democracy and direct democracy is
a great deal less marked than political sentimentalists
assume. Under both forms the sovereign
mob must employ agents to execute its will, and
in either case the agents may have ideas of their
own, based upon interests of their own, and the
means at hand to do and get what they will.
Moreover, their very position gives them a power
of influencing the electors that is far above that
of any ordinary citizen: they become politicians
<i lang="la">ex officio</i>, and usually end by selling such influence
as remains after they have used all they
need for their own ends. Worse, both forms
of democracy encounter the difficulty that the
generality of citizens, no matter how assiduously
they may be instructed, remain congenitally unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
to comprehend many of the problems before
them, or to consider all of those they do
comprehend in an unbiased and intelligent manner.
Thus it is often impossible to ascertain
their views in advance of action, or even, in
many cases, to determine their conclusions <i lang="la">post
hoc</i>. The voters gathered in a typical New England
town-meeting were all ardent amateurs of
theology, and hence quite competent, in theory,
to decide the theological questions that principally
engaged them; nevertheless, history shows
that they were led facilely by professional
theologians, most of them quacks with something
to sell. In the same way, the great masses of
Americans of to-day, though they are theoretically
competent to decide all the larger matters
of national policy, and have certain immutable
principles, of almost religious authority, to
guide them, actually look for leading to professional
politicians, who are influenced in turn by
small but competent and determined minorities,
with special knowledge and special interests. It
was thus that the plain people were shoved into
the late war, and it is thus that they will be
shoved into the next one. They were, in overwhelming
majority, against going in, and if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
had had any sense and resolution they would
have stayed out. But these things they lacked.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_77">2.</h3>

<p><i>The Popular Will</i></p>

<p>Thus there is no need to differentiate too
pedantically between the two forms of democratic
government, for their unlikeness is far
more apparent than real. Nor is there any need
to set up any distinction between the sort of
democracy that is met with in practice, with its
constant conflicts between what is assumed to be
the popular will and the self-interest of small
but articulate and efficient groups, and that
theoretical variety which would liberate and
energize the popular will completely. The latter
must remain purely theoretical for all time;
there are insuperable impediments, solidly
grounded in the common mind, to its realization.
Moreover, there is no reason for believing
that its realization, if it should ever be attained
by miracle, would materially change the
main outlines of the democratic process. What
is genuinely important is not that the will of
mankind in the mass should be formulated and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
made effective at all times and in every case,
but simply that means should be provided for
ascertaining and executing it in capital cases—that
there shall be no immovable impediment to
its execution when, by some prodigy of nature, it
takes a coherent and apposite form. If, over
and beyond that, a sufficient sense of its immanent
and imminent potency remains to make
politicians walk a bit warily, if the threat always
hangs in the air that under <i>x</i> circumstances and
on <i>y</i> day it may be heard from suddenly and
devastatingly, then democracy is actually in being.
This is the case, it seems to me, in the
United States. And it is the case, too, in every
European country west of Vienna and north of
the Alps.</p>

<p>The American people, true enough, are sheep.
Worse, they are donkeys. Yet worse, to borrow
from their own dialect, they are goats.
They are thus constantly bamboozled and exploited
by small minorities of their own number,
by determined and ambitious individuals,
and even by exterior groups. The business of
victimizing them is a lucrative profession, an
exact science, and a delicate and lofty art. It
has its masters and it has its quacks. Its lowest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
reward is a seat in Congress or a job as a
Prohibition agent, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a licensed blackleg; its
highest reward is immortality. The adept practitioner
is not only rewarded; he is also thanked.
The victims delight in his ministrations, as an
hypochondriacal woman delights in the flayings
of the surgeon. But all the while they have the
means in their hands to halt the obscenity whenever
it becomes intolerable, and now and then,
raised transiently to a sort of intelligence, they
do put a stop to it. There are no legal or other
bars to the free functioning of their will, once
it emerges into consciousness, save only such
bars as they themselves have erected, and these
they may remove whenever they so desire. No
external or super-legal power stands beyond their
reach, exercising pressure upon them; they
recognize no personal sovereign with inalienable
rights and no class with privileges above the
common law; they are even kept free, by a tradition
as old as the Republic itself, of foreign alliances
which would condition their autonomy.
Thus their sovereignty, though it is limited in
its everyday exercise by self-imposed constitutional
checks and still more by restraints which
lie in the very nature of government, whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
its form, is probably just as complete in essence
as that of the most absolute monarch who ever
hanged a peasant or defied the Pope.</p>

<p>What is too often forgotten, in discussing the
matter, is the fact that no such monarch was ever
actually free, at all times and under all conditions.
In the midst of his most charming tyrannies
he had still to bear it in mind that his people,
oppressed too much, could always rise
against him, and that he himself, though a king
<i lang="de">von Gottes Gnaden</i>, was yet biologically only a
man, with but one gullet to slit; and if the people
were feeble or too craven to be dangerous, then
there was always His Holiness of Rome to fear
or other agents of the King of Kings; and if these
ghostly mentors, too, were silent, then he had to
reckon with his ministers, his courtiers, his soldiers,
his doctors, and his women. The Merovingian
kings were certainly absolute, if absolutism
has ever existed outside the dreams of
historians; nevertheless, as every schoolboy
knows, their sovereignty was gradually undermined
by the mayors of the palace, and finally
taken from them altogether. So with the emperors
of Japan, who succumbed to the shoguns,
who succumbed in their turn to a combination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
of territorial nobles and city capitalists, not unlike
that which brought King John to bay at
Runnymede. It seems to me that the common
people, under such a democracy as that which
now prevails in the United States, are more completely
sovereign, in fact as well as in law, than
any of these ancient despots. They may be seduced
and enchained by a great variety of prehensile
soothsayers, just as Henry VIII was
seduced and enchained by his wives, but, like
Henry again, they are quite free to throw off
their chains whenever they please, and to chop
off the heads of their seducers. They could
hang Dr. Coolidge to-morrow if they really
wanted to do it, or even Bishop Manning. They
could do it by the simple device of intimidating
Congress, which never fails to leap when their
growl is palpably in earnest. And if Congress
stood out against them, they could do it anyhow,
under protection of the jury system. The executioners,
once acquitted, could not be molested
more, save by illegal processes. Similar executioners
walk the land to-day, especially in the
South, and no one dares to challenge them. They
are visible symbols of the powers that lie in the
mob, once it makes up its mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Nor is there much force or relevancy in the
contention that democracy is incomplete in the
United States (as in England, France, Germany
and all other democratic countries) because certain
classes of persons are barred from full
citizenship, sometimes for reasons that appear to
be unsound. To argue thus is to argue against
democracy itself, for if the majority has not the
right to decide what qualifications shall be necessary
to participate in its sovereignty, then it has
no sovereignty at all. What one usually finds,
on examining any given case of class disfranchisement,
is that the class disfranchised is not
actively eager, as a whole, for the ballot, and that
its lack of interest in the matter is at least presumptive
evidence of its general political incompetence.
The three-class system of voting
survived so long in Belgium and Prussia, not
because the masses victimized had no means at
hand to put an end to it, but simply because they
were so inept at politics, and so indifferent to
the rights involved, that they made no genuine
effort to do so. The agitation against the system
was carried on mainly by a small minority, and
many of its leaders were not even members of
the class transgressed. Here we have a reminder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of the process whereby democracy itself
came in: it was forced upon its beneficiaries by
a small group of visionaries, all of them standing
outside the class benefited. So again, in our
own time, with the extension of the franchise to
women. The great masses of women in all
countries were indifferent to the boon, and there
was a considerable body that was cynically hostile.
Perhaps a majority of the more ardent
suffragists belonged biologically to neither sex.</p>

<p>Since the abolition of the three-class system
in Prussia there has been absolutely no improvement
in the government of that country; on the
contrary, there has been a vast falling off in its
honesty and efficiency, and it has even slackened
energy in what was formerly one of its most
laudable specialties: the development of legislation
for the protection of the working class,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the very class that benefited politically by
the change. Giving women the ballot, as everyone
knows, has brought in none of the great reforms
promised by the suffragists. It has substituted
adultery for drunkenness as the principal
divertissement at political conventions, but it
has accomplished little else. The majority of
women, when they vote at all, seem to vote unwillingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and without clear purpose; they are,
perhaps, relatively too intelligent to have any
faith in purely political remedies for the sorrows
of the world. The minorities that show partisan
keenness are chiefly made up of fat women with
inattentive husbands; they are victimized easily
by the male politicians, especially those who
dress well, and are thus swallowed up by the
great parties, and lose all separate effectiveness.
Certainly it is usually difficult to discover, in the
election returns, any division along anatomical
lines. Now and then, true enough, a sentimentality
appealing especially to the more stupid
sort of women causes a transient differentiation,
as when, for example, thousands of newly-enfranchised
farm-wives in the United States
voted against Cox, the Democratic presidential
candidate, in 1920, on the double ground (<i>a</i>)
that he was a divorcé and hence an antinomian,
and (<i>b</i>) that the titular chief of his party, Dr.
Wilson, had married again too soon after the
death of his first wife. But such fantastic sentimentalities,
after all, rarely enter into practical
politics. When they are lacking the women
voters simply succumb to the sentimentalities
that happen to be engaging their lords and masters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
The extension of the franchise has not
changed the general nature of the political
clown-show in the slightest. Campaigns are still
made upon the same old issues, and offices go
to the same old mountebanks, with a few Jezebels
added to the corps to give it refinement.</p>

<p>There is little reason for believing that the extension
of the franchise to the classes that still
remain in the dark would make government more
delicately responsive to the general will. Such
classes, as a matter of fact, are now so few and
so small in numbers in all of the Western nations
that they may be very conveniently disregarded.
It is as if doctors of philosophy,
members of the Society of the Cincinnati or men
who could move their ears were disfranchised.
In the United States, true enough, there is one
disfranchised group that is much larger, to wit,
that group of Americans whose African descent
is visible to the naked eye and at a glance. But
even in this case, the reality falls much below
the appearance. The more intelligent American
Negroes vote in spite of the opposition of the
poor whites, their theological brothers and economic
rivals, and not a few of them actually
make their livings as professional politicians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
even in the South. At the Republican National
Convention at Chicago, in 1920, such a swart
statesman gave an inspiring exhibition of his
powers, and in the presence of a vast multitude.
His name was Henry Lincoln Johnson, and he
has since gone to that bourn where black is
white. When he died Dr. Coolidge sent a long
and flirtatious telegram of condolence to his
widow. The widow of Jacques Loeb got no such
telegram. This Johnson was chairman of the
Georgia delegation, and his colleagues were all
of the Nordic race. But though they came from
the very citadel of the Ku Klux Klan, he herded
them in a public and lordly manner, and voted
them as if they had been stuffed chemises. As
Nordics, no doubt, they viewed him with a bitter
loathing, but as politicians yearning for jobs
they had to be polite to him, and even fawning.
He has his peers and successors in all the American
States. In many a proud city, North and
South, the Aframericans hold the balance of
power, and know it.</p>

<p>Moreover, even those who are actually disfranchised,
say in the rural wastes of the South,
may remove their disability by the simple device
of moving away, as, in fact, hundreds of thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
have done. Their disfranchisement is
thus not intrinsic and complete, but merely a
function of their residence, like that of all persons,
white or black, who live in the District
of Columbia, and so it takes on a secondary and
trivial character, as hay-fever, in the pathological
categories, takes on a secondary and trivial
character by yielding to a change of climate.
Moreover, it is always extra-legal, and thus
remains dubious: the theory of the fundamental
law is that the coloured folk may and do vote.
This theory they could convert into a fact at any
time by determined mass action. The Nordics
might resist that action, but they could not halt
it: there would be another Civil War if they
tried to do so, and they would be beaten a second
time. If the blacks in the backwaters of the
South keep away from the polls to-day it is only
because they do not esteem the ballot highly
enough to risk the dangers that go with trying
to use it. That fact, it seems to me, convicts
them of unfitness for citizenship in a democratic
state, for the loftiest of all the rights of the citizen,
by the democratic dogma, is that of the
franchise, and whoever is not willing to fight for
it, even at the cost of his last drop of gore, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
surely not likely to exercise it with a proper
sense of consecration after getting it. No one
argues that democracy is destroyed in the United
States by the fact that millions of white citizens,
perfectly free under the law and the local <i lang="fr">mores</i>
of their communities to vote, nevertheless fail to
do so. The difference between these negligent
whites and the disfranchised Negroes is only
superficial. Both have a clear legal right to the
ballot; if they neglect to exercise it, it is only
because they do not esteem it sufficiently. In
New York City thousands of freeborn Caucasians
surrender it in order to avoid jury duty;
in the South thousands of Negroes surrender it in
order to avoid having their homes burned and
their heads broken. The two motives are fundamentally
identical; in each case the potential
voter values his peace and security more than
he values the boon for which the Fathers bled.
He certainly has a right to choose.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_88">3.</h3>

<p><i>Disproportional Representation</i></p>

<p>The matter of disproportional representation,
already alluded to in connection with the Prussian-Belgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
voting system, is intimately bound
up with this question of disfranchised classes,
for it must be plain that a community whose
votes, man for man, count for only half as much
as the votes of another community is one in
which half of the citizens are, to every practical
intent, unable to vote at all. As everyone
knows, the United States Senate is constituted
upon a disproportional plan. Each State, regardless
of population, has two Senators and no
more, and the votes of the two representing so
small and measly a State as Delaware or Nevada
count for precisely as much as the votes of the
Senators from Pennsylvania or New York. The
same sophistication of the one-man-one-vote formula
extends into the States themselves. There
is hardly a large city in the United States that
has completely proportional representation in
the State Legislature. In almost every State,
sometimes with slight ameliorative differences,
the upper house of the Legislature is constituted
upon the plan of the Federal Senate—that is,
the divisions run according to geographical
boundaries rather than according to population,
and the congested urban centres tend to be
grossly under-represented. Moreover, the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
house commonly shows something of the same
disharmony, even when it is ostensibly based
upon proportional representation, for the cities
grow in population much faster than the country
districts, and reapportionment always lags behind
that growth.</p>

<p>These facts fever certain romantic fuglemen
of so-called pure democracy, and they come forward
with complicated remedies, all of which
have been tried somewhere or other and failed
miserably. The truth is that disproportional
representation is not a device to nullify democracy,
but simply a device to make it more workable.
All it indicates, at least in the United
States, is that the sovereign people have voluntarily
sacrificed a moiety of the democratic
theory in order to attain to a safer and more efficient
practice. If they so desired they could
sweep all of the existing inequalities out of
existence—not instantly, perhaps, but nevertheless
surely. Every such inequality is founded
upon their free will, and nearly every one enjoys
their complete approval. What lies under most
of them is not a wish to give one voter an advantage
over another, but a wish to counter-balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
an advantage lying in the very nature
of things. The voters of a large urban centre,
for example, are able to act together far more
promptly and effectively than their colleagues of
the wide-flung farms. They live in close contact
both physically and mentally; opinions form
among them quickly, and are maintained with
solid front. In brief, they show all of the characters
of men in a compact mob, and the voters
of the rural regions, dispersed and largely inarticulate,
cannot hope to prevail against them
by ordinary means. So the yokels are given
disproportionally heavy representation by way
of make-weight: it enables them to withstand
the city stampede. There are frequent protests
from the cities when, taking advantage of their
strength in the State Legislatures, the yokels
dodge their fair share of the burden of taxation,
but it is perhaps significant that there is seldom
any serious protest against the plan of organization
of the United States Senate, despite the fact
that it has cursed the country with such bucolic
imbecilities as Prohibition. In both cases, genuine
discontent would make itself felt, for the
majority under democracy remains the majority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
whatever laws and constitutions may say to the
contrary, and when its blood is up it can get
anything it wants.</p>

<p>Most of the so-called constitutional checks, in
fact, have yielded, at one time or other, to its
pressure. No one familiar with the history of
the Supreme Court, for example, need be told
that its vast and singular power to curb legislation
has always been exercised with one eye
on the election returns. Practically all of its
most celebrated decisions, from that in the Dred
Scott case to that in the Northern Securities case,
have reflected popular rages of the hour, and
many of them have been modified, or even completely
reversed afterward, as the second thought
of the plain people has differed from their first
thought. This responsiveness to the shifts of
popular opinion and passion is not alone due
to the fact that the personnel of the court, owing
to the high incidence of senile deterioration
among its members, is constantly changing, and
that the President and the Senators, in filling
vacancies, are bound as practical politicians to
consider the doctrines that happen to be fashionable
in the cross-roads grocery-stores and
barber-shops. It is also due, and in no small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
measure, to the fact that the learned and puissant
justices are, in the main, practical politicians
themselves, and hence used to keeping
their ears close to the grass-roots. Most of them,
before they were elevated to the ermine, spent
years struggling desperately for less exalted honours,
and so, like Representatives, Senators and
Presidents, they show a fine limberness of the
<i lang="la">biceps femoris</i>, <i lang="la">semitendinosus</i> and <i lang="la">semimembranosus</i>,
and a beautiful talent for reconciling
the ideally just with the privately profitable.
If their general tendency, in late years, has
been to put the rights of property above the rights
of man then it must be obvious that they have not
lost any popularity thereby. In boom times, indeed,
democracy is always very impatient of what
used to be called natural rights. The typical
democrat is quite willing to exchange any of the
theoretical boons of freedom for something that
he can use. In most cases, perhaps, he is averse
to selling his vote for cash in hand, but that is
mainly because the price offered is usually too
low. He will sell it very willingly for a good
job or for some advantage in his business. Offering
him such bribes, in fact, is the chief
occupation of all political parties under democracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and of all professional politicians.</p>

<p>For all these reasons I esteem it a vanity to
discuss the question whether the democracy on
tap in the United States is really ideal. Ideal
or not, it works, and the people are actually
sovereign. The governmental process, perhaps,
could be made more quickly responsive to the
public will, but that is merely a temporal detail;
it is responsive enough for all practical purposes.
Any conceivable change in the laws could be effected
without tampering with the fundamental
scheme. The fact, no doubt, largely explains
the hostility of the inferior American to the thing
called direct action—the darling of his equals in
most other countries. He is against it, not
merely because he is a coward and distrusts
liberty, but also, and maybe mainly, because he
believes that revolution, in the United States, is
unnecessary—that any reform advocated by a
respectable majority, or even by a determined
minority, may be achieved peacefully and by
constitutional means. In this belief he is right.
The American people, keeping strictly within the
Constitution, could do anything that the most
soaring fancy suggested. They could, by a
simple amendment of that hoary scripture, expropriate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
all the private property in the land,
or they could expropriate parts of it and
leave the rest in private hands; they have already,
in fact, by tariff juggling, by Prohibition
and by other devices, destroyed billions of dollars
of property without compensation and even without
common politeness, and the Constitution still
survives. They could enfranchise aliens if they
so desired, or children not taxed, or idiots, or the
kine in the byres. They could disfranchise
whole classes, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, metaphysicians or adulterers,
or the entire population of given regions.
They have done such things. They could abolish
the Federal and State Legislatures, as they
have already abolished the city councils in hundreds
of municipalities. They could extend the
term of the President to life, or they could reduce
it to one year, or even to one day. They
could provide that he must shave his head, or
that he must sleep in his underclothes. They
could legalize his assassination for malfeasance,
and the assassination of all other recreant public
officers, as I myself once proposed, entirely
within my rights as a citizen and a patriot.
They could introduce burning at the stake, flogging,
castration, ducking and tar-and-feathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
into our system of legal punishment; they have
already done so in the South by acclamation,
regardless of the law and the courts, and, as
the phrase is, have got away with it. They
could abolish the jury system, abandon the
writ of <i lang="la">habeas corpus</i>, authorize unreasonable
searches and seizures, legalize murder by public
officers and provide that all Federal judges be
appointed by the Anti-Saloon League: a beginning
has been made in all these fields by the
Volstead Act. They could make war without
constitutional authority and refuse to engage in
it in the face of a constitutional declaration.
They could proscribe individuals or classes, and
deny them the protection of the laws. They
could convert arson into a laudable act, provide
a bounty for persons skilled at mayhem and
make it a crime to drink coffee or eat meat.
They have already, either by Federal action or by
State action, made crimes of such intrinsically
harmless acts as drinking wine at meals, smoking
cigarettes on the street, teaching the elements
of biology, wearing a red necktie on the street,
and reading “Das Kapital” and “The Inestimable
Life of the Great Gargantua.” They
could, with equal facility, make it criminal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
refuse to do these things. Finally, they could,
if they would, abandon the republican form of
government altogether, and set up a monarchy
in place of it; during the late war they actually
did so in fact, though refraining from saying so
frankly. They could do all of these things freely
and even legally, without departing in the slightest
from the principles of their fundamental compact,
and no exterior agency could make them
do any of them unwillingly.</p>

<p>It is thus idle to amass proofs, as Hans Delbrück
does with great diligence, that the result
of this or that election was not a manifestation of
a concrete popular wish. The answer, nine
times out of ten, is that there <em>was</em> no popular
wish. The populace simply passed over the matters
principally at issue as incomprehensible or
unimportant, and voted irrelevantly or wantonly.
Or, in large part, it kept away from the polls.
Both actions might be defended plausibly by
democratic theorists. The people, if they are
actually sovereign, have a clear right to be wanton
when the spirit moves them, and indifference to
an issue is an expression of opinion about it.
Thus there is little appositeness in the saying of
another German, the philosopher Hegel, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
masses are that part of the state which doesn’t
know what it wants. They know what they want
when they actually want it, and if they want it
badly enough they get it. What they want
principally are safety and security. They want
to be delivered from the bugaboos that ride them.
They want to be soothed with mellifluous words.
They want heroes to worship. They want the
rough entertainment suitable to their simple
minds. All of these things they want so badly
that they are willing to sacrifice everything else
in order to get them. The science of politics under
democracy consists in trading with them,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, in hoodwinking and swindling them. In
return for what they want, or for the mere appearance
of what they want, they yield up what
the politician wants, and what the enterprising
minorities behind him want. The bargaining is
conducted to the tune of affecting rhetoric, with
music by the choir, but it is as simple and sordid
at bottom as the sale of a mule. It lies quite
outside the bounds of honour, and even of common
decency. It is a combat between jackals
and jackasses. It is the master transaction of
democratic states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>


<h3 id="toclink_99">4.</h3>

<p><i>The Politician Under Democracy</i></p>

<p>I find myself quoting yet a third German: he
is Professor Robert Michels, the economist. The
politician, he says, is the courtier of democracy.
A profound saying—perhaps more profound
than the professor, himself a democrat, realizes.
For it was of the essence of the courtier’s art and
mystery that he flattered his employer in order to
victimize him, yielded to him in order to rule
him. The politician under democracy does precisely
the same thing. His business is never
what it pretends to be. Ostensibly he is an
altruist devoted whole-heartedly to the service of
his fellow-men, and so abjectly public-spirited
that his private interest is nothing to him. Actually
he is a sturdy rogue whose principal, and
often sole aim in life is to butter his parsnips.
His technical equipment consists simply of an
armamentarium of deceits. It is his business to
get and hold his job at all costs. If he can hold
it by lying he will hold it by lying; if lying
peters out he will try to hold it by embracing
new truths. His ear is ever close to the ground.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
If he is an adept he can hear the first murmurs
of popular clamour before even the people themselves
are conscious of them. If he is a master
he detects and whoops up to-day the delusions
that the mob will cherish next year. There is
in him, in his professional aspect, no shadow of
principle or honour. It is moral by his code
to get into office by false pretences, as the late
Dr. Wilson did in 1916. It is moral to change
convictions overnight, as multitudes of American
politicians did when the Prohibition avalanche
came down upon them. Anything is
moral that furthers the main concern of his
soul, which is to keep a place at the public
trough. That place is one of public honour,
and public honour is the thing that caresses
him and makes him happy. It is also one of
power, and power is the commodity that he has
for sale.</p>

<p>I speak here, of course, of the democratic politician
in his rôle of statesman—that is, in his
best and noblest aspect. He flourishes also on
lower levels, partly subterranean. Down there
public honour would be an inconvenience, so he
hawks it to lesser men, and contents himself with
power. What are the sources of that power?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
They lie, obviously, in the gross weaknesses and
knaveries of the common people—in their inability
to grasp any issues save the simplest and
most banal, in their incurable tendency to fly into
preposterous alarms, in their petty self-seeking
and venality, in their instinctive envy and hatred
of their superiors—in brief, in their congenital
incapacity for the elemental duties of citizens
in a civilized state. The boss owns them simply
because they can be bought for a job on the street
or a load of coal. He holds them, even when
they pass beyond any need of jobs or coal, by
his shrewd understanding of their immemorial
sentimentalities. Looking at Thersites, they see
Ulysses. He is the state as they apprehend it;
around him clusters all the romance that used to
hang about a king. He is the fount of honour
and the mould of form. His barbaric code,
framed to fit their gullibility, becomes an example
to their young. The boss is the eternal
<i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> of the whole democratic
process. He exemplifies its reduction of all
ideas to a few elemental wants. And he reflects
and makes manifest the inferior man’s congenital
fear of liberty—his incapacity for even the
most trivial sort of independent action. Life on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
the lower levels is life in a series of interlocking
despotisms. The inferior man cannot imagine
himself save as taking orders—if not from the
boss, then from the priest, and if not from the
priest, then from some fantastic drill-sergeant of
his own creation. For years the reformers who
flourished in the United States concentrated their
whole animus upon the boss: it was apparently
their notion that he had imposed himself upon
his victims from without, and that they could be
delivered by destroying him. But time threw a
brilliant light upon that error. When, as and
if he was overthrown there appeared in his place
the prehensile Methodist parson, bawling for
Prohibition and its easy jobs, and behind the parson
loomed the grand goblin, natural heir to a
long line of imperial worthy potentates of the
Sons of Azrael and sublime chancellors of the
Order of Patriarchs Militant. The winds of the
world are bitter to <i>Homo vulgaris</i>. He likes
the warmth and safety of the herd, and he likes a
bell-wether with a clarion bell.</p>

<p>The art of politics, under democracy, is simply
the art of ringing it. Two branches reveal
themselves. There is the art of the demagogue,
and there is the art of what may be called, by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
shot-gun marriage of Latin and Greek, the demaslave.
They are complementary, and both of
them are degrading to their practitioners. The
demagogue is one who preaches doctrines he
knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiots.
The demaslave is one who listens to what these
idiots have to say and then pretends that he believes
it himself. Every man who seeks elective
office under democracy has to be either the one
thing or the other, and most men have to be both.
The whole process is one of false pretences and
ignoble concealments. No educated man, stating
plainly the elementary notions that every
educated man holds about the matters that principally
concern government, could be elected to
office in a democratic state, save perhaps by a
miracle. His frankness would arouse fears, and
those fears would run against him; it is his business
to arouse fears that will run in favour of
him. Worse, he must not only consider the weaknesses
of the mob, but also the prejudices of
the minorities that prey upon it. Some of these
minorities have developed a highly efficient technique
of intimidation. They not only know how
to arouse the fears of the mob; they also know
how to awaken its envy, its dislike of privilege,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
its hatred of its betters. How formidable they
may become is shown by the example of the
Anti-Saloon League in the United States—a
minority body in the strictest sense, however
skillful its mustering of popular support, for it
nowhere includes a majority of the voters among
its subscribing members, and its leaders are nowhere
chosen by democratic methods. And how
such minorities may intimidate the whole class
of place-seeking politicians has been demonstrated
brilliantly and obscenely by the same
corrupt and unconscionable organization. It
has filled all the law-making bodies of the nation
with men who have got into office by submitting
cravenly to its dictation, and it has filled
thousands of administrative posts, and not a few
judicial posts, with vermin of the same sort.</p>

<p>Such men, indeed, enjoy vast advantages under
democracy. The mob, insensitive to their
dishonour, is edified and exhilarated by their success.
The competition they offer to men of a
decenter habit is too powerful to be met, so they
tend, gradually, to monopolize all the public
offices. Out of the muck of their swinishness the
typical American law-maker emerges. He is a
man who has lied and dissembled, and a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
who has crawled. He knows the taste of boot-polish.
He has suffered kicks in the tonneau
of his pantaloons. He has taken orders from
his superiors in knavery and he has wooed and
flattered his inferiors in sense. His public life
is an endless series of evasions and false pretences.
He is willing to embrace any issue, however
idiotic, that will get him votes, and he is
willing to sacrifice any principle, however sound,
that will lose them for him. I do not describe
the democratic politician at his inordinate worst;
I describe him as he is encountered in the full
sunshine of normalcy. He may be, on the one
hand, a cross-roads idler striving to get into the
State Legislature by grace of the local mortgage-sharks
and evangelical clergy, or he may be,
on the other, the President of the United States.
It is almost an axiom that no man may make a
career in politics in the Republic without stooping
to such ignobility: it is as necessary as a loud
voice. Now and then, to be sure, a man of
sounder self-respect may make a beginning, but
he seldom gets very far. Those who survive
are nearly all tarred, soon or late, with the same
stick. They are men who, at some time or other,
have compromised with their honour, either by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
swallowing their convictions or by whooping
for what they believe to be untrue. They are
in the position of the chorus girl who, in order
to get her humble job, has had to admit the
manager to her person. And the old birds
among them, like chorus girls of long experience,
come to regard the business resignedly and
even complacently. It is the price that a man
who loves the clapper-clawing of the vulgar must
pay for it under the democratic system. He
becomes a coward and a trimmer <i lang="la">ex officio</i>.
Where his dignity was in the days of his innocence
there is now only a vacuum in the wastes
of his subconscious. Vanity remains to him,
but not pride.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_106">5.</h3>

<p><i>Utopia</i></p>

<p>Thus the ideal of democracy is reached at
last: it has become a psychic impossibility for
a gentleman to hold office under the Federal
Union, save by a combination of miracles that
must tax the resourcefulness even of God. The
fact has been rammed home by a constitutional
amendment: every office-holder, when he takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
oath to support the Constitution, must swear on
his honour that, summoned to the death-bed of
his grandmother, he will not take the old lady
a bottle of wine. He may say so and do it,
which makes him a liar, or he may say so
and not do it, which makes him a pig. But
despite that grim dilemma there are still idealists,
chiefly professional Liberals, who argue
that it is the duty of a gentleman to go into
politics—that there is a way out of the quagmire
in that direction. The remedy, it seems to me,
is quite as absurd as all the other sure cures that
Liberals advocate. When they argue for it, they
simply argue, in words but little changed, that
the remedy for prostitution is to fill the bawdy-houses
with virgins. My impression is that this
last device would accomplish very little: either
the virgins would leap out of the windows, or
they would cease to be virgins. The same alternatives
confront the political aspirant who is
what is regarded in America as a gentleman—that
is, who is one not susceptible to open bribery
in cash. The moment his leg goes over the political
fence, he finds the mob confronting him,
and if he would stay within he must adapt himself
to its tastes and prejudices. In other words,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
he must learn all the tricks of the regular
mountebanks. When the mob pricks up its ears
and begins to whinny, he must soothe it with
balderdash. He must allay its resentment of
the fact that he is washed behind the ears. He
must anticipate its crazes, and join in them
vociferously. He must regard its sensitiveness
on points of morals, and get what advantage he
can out of his anæsthesia on points of honour.
More, he must make terms with the mob-masters
already performing upon its spines, chiefly
agents of prehensile minorities. If he neglects
these devices he is swiftly heaved over the fence,
and his career in statecraft is at an end.</p>

<p>Here I do not theorize; there are examples innumerable.
It is an axiom of practical politics,
indeed, that the worst enemies of political
decency are the tired reformers—and the worst
of the worst are those whose primary thirst to
make the corruptible put on incorruption was
accompanied by a somewhat sniffish class consciousness.
Has the United States ever seen a
more violent and shameless demagogue than
Theodore Roosevelt? Yet Roosevelt came into
politics as a sword drawn against demagogy.
The list of such recusants might be run to great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
lengths: I point to the late Mitchel of New York
and the late Lodge of Massachusetts and pass
on. Lodge lived long enough to become a magnificent
<i lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i> of the gentleman
turned democratic messiah. It was a sheer impossibility,
during the last ten years of his life,
to disentangle his private convictions from the
fabric of his political dodges. He was the perfect
model of the party hack, and if he performed
before the actual mob less unchastely
than Roosevelt it was only because his somewhat
absurd façade unfitted him for that science. He
dealt in jobs in a wholesale manner, and with
the hearty devotion of a Penrose or a Henry
Lincoln Johnson. Popularly regarded as an unflinching
and even adamantine fellow, he was
actually as limber as an eel. He knew how
to jump. He knew when to whisper and when
to yell. As I say, I could print a long roster
of similar apostates; the name of Penrose himself
should not be forgotten. I do not say that
a gentleman may not thrust himself into politics
under democracy; I simply say that it is almost
impossible for him to stay there and remain a
gentleman. The haughty amateur, at the start,
may actually make what seems to be a brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
success, for he is commonly full of indignation,
and so strikes out valiantly, and the mob crowds
up because it likes a brutal show. But that first
battle is almost always his last. If he retains
his rectitude he loses his office, and if he retains
his office he has to dilute his rectitude with the
cologne spirits of the trade.</p>

<p>Such is the pride that we pay for the great
boon of democracy: the man of native integrity
is either barred from the public service altogether,
or subjected to almost irresistible temptations
after he gets in. The competition of less
honourable man is more than he can bear. He
must stand against them before the mob, and the
sempiternal prejudices of the mob run their way.
In most other countries of a democratic tendency—for
example, England—this outlawry and corruption
of the best is checked by an aristocratic
tradition—an anachronism, true enough, but still
extremely powerful, and yielding to the times
only under immense pressure. The English
aristocracy (aided, in part, by the plutocracy,
which admires and envies it) not only keeps a
large share of the principal offices in its own
hands, regardless of popular rages and party
fortunes; it also preserves an influence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
hence a function, for its non-officeholding members.
The scholarship of Oxford and Cambridge,
for example, can still make itself felt
at Westminster, despite the fact that the vast
majority of the actual members of the Commons
are ignoramuses. But in the United States there
is no aristocracy, whether intellectual or otherwise,
and so the scholarship of Harvard, such
as it is, is felt no more on Capitol Hill than it
is at Westerville, Ohio. The class of politicians,
indeed, tends to separate itself sharply
from all other classes. There is none of that
interpenetration on the higher levels which marks
older and more secure societies. Roosevelt, an
imitation aristocrat, was the first and only American
President since Washington to make any
effort to break down the barriers. A man of
saucy and even impertinent curiosities, and very
eager to appear to the vulgar as an Admirable
Crichton, he made his table the resort of all sorts
and conditions of men. Among them were some
who actually knew something about this or that,
and from them he probably got useful news and
advice. Beethoven, if he had been alive, would
have been invited to the White House, and Goethe
would have come with him. But that eagerness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
for contacts outside the bounds of professional
politics is certainly not a common mark of American
Presidents, nor, of American public officials
of any sort. When the lamented Harding
sat in Lincoln’s chair his hours of ease were
spent with bootleggers, not with metaphysicians;
his notion of a good time was to refresh himself
in the manner of a small-town Elk, at golf, poker,
and guzzling. The tastes of his successor are
even narrower: the loftiest guests he entertains
upon the <i>Mayflower</i> are the editors of party
newspapers, and there is no evidence that he
is acquainted with a single intelligent man. The
average American Governor is of the same kidney.
He comes into contact with the local
<i lang="de">Gelehrte</i> only when a bill is up to prohibit the
teaching of the elements of biology in the State
university.</p>

<p>The judiciary, under the American system,
sinks quite as low. Save when, by some miscarriage
of politics, a Brandeis, a Holmes, a
Cardozo or a George W. Anderson is elevated
to the bench, it carries on its dull and preposterous
duties quite outside the stream of civilized
thought, and even outside the stream of
enlightened juridic thought. Very few American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
judges ever contribute anything of value to
legal theory. One seldom hears of them protesting,
either <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i> or as citizens, against
the extravagances and absurdities that fast reduce
the whole legal system of the country to
imbecility; they seem to be quite content to enforce
any sort of law that is provided for their
use by ignorant and corrupt legislators, regardless
of its conflict with fundamental human
rights. The Constitution apparently has no
more meaning to them than it has to a Prohibition
agent. They have acquiesced almost
unanimously in the destruction of the First, Second,
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and
supinely connived at the invasion of the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth. The reason is not far to
seek. The average American judge, in his days
at the bar, was not a leader but a trailer. The
judicial office is not attractive, as a rule, to the
better sort of lawyers. We have such a multiplicity
of courts that it has become common,
and judges are so often chosen for purely political
reasons, even for the Supreme Court of the
United States, that the lawyer of professional
dignity and self-respect hesitates to enter into
the competition. Thus the bench tends to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
filled with duffers, and many of them are also
scoundrels, as the frequent complaints against
their extortions and tyrannies testify. The English
bench, as everyone knows, is immensely
better: the fact is often noted with lamentation
by American lawyers. And why? Simply because
the governing oligarchy in England, lingering
on in spite of the democratic upheaval,
keeps jealous guard over the judiciary in the
interest of its own class, and thereby prevents the
elevation of the preposterous shysters who so
frequently attain to the ermine in America.
Even when, under the pressure of parlous times,
it admits an F.&nbsp;E. Smith to the bench, it at least
makes sure that he is a competent lawyer. The
way is thus blocked to downright ignoramuses,
and English jurisprudence, so much more fluent
and reasonable than our own, is protected
against their dull stupidities. Genuine talent,
however humble its origin, may get in, but not
imbecility, however pretentious. In the United
States the thing runs the other way. In the
States, where judges are commonly elected by
popular vote, the shyster has every advantage
over the reputable lawyer, including that of
yearning for the judicial salary with a vast and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
undivided passion. And when it comes to the
Federal courts, once so honourable, he has every
advantage again, including the formidable one
of knowing how to crook his knee gracefully to
the local dispenser of Federal patronage (in the
South, often a worthless Negro) and to the
Methodist wowsers of the Anti-Saloon League.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_115">6.</h3>

<p><i>The Occasional Exception</i></p>

<p>I do not argue, of course, that the shyster
invariably prevails. As I have said, a man of
unquestionable integrity and ability occasionally
gets to the bench, even of the State courts. In
the same way a man of unquestionable integrity
and ability sometimes finds himself in high executive
or legislative office; there are even a few
cases of such men getting into the White House.
But the thing doesn’t happen often, and when
it does happen it is only by a failure of the rule.
The self-respecting candidate obviously cannot
count on that failure: the odds are heavily
against him from the start, and every effort he
makes to diminish them involves some compromise
with complete candour. He may take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
refuge in cynicism, and pursue the cozening of
the populace as a sort of intellectual exercise,
cruel but not unamusing, or he may accept the
conditions of the game resignedly, and charge
up the necessary dodges and false pretences to
spiritual profit and loss, as a chorus girl charges
up her favours to the manager and his backer;
but in either case he has parted with something
that must be tremendously valuable to a self-respecting
man, and is even more valuable to
the country he serves than it is to himself. Contemplating
such a body as the national House of
Representatives one sees only a group of men
who have compromised with honour—in brief,
a group of male Magdalens. They have been
broken to the goose-step. They have learned
how to leap through the hoops of professional
job-mongers and Prohibitionist blackmailers.
They have kept silent about good causes, and
spoken in causes that they knew to be evil. The
higher they rise, the further they fall. The occasional
mavericks, thrown in by miracle, last
a session, and then disappear. The old Congressman,
the veteran of genuine influence and
power, is either one who is so stupid that the
ideas of the mob are his own ideas, or one so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
far gone in charlatanry that he is unconscious
of his shame. Our laws are made, in the main,
by men who have sold their honour for their
jobs, and they are executed by men who put
their jobs above justice and common sense. The
occasional cynics leaven the mass. We are
dependent for whatever good flows out of democracy
upon men who do not believe in
democracy.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, it will be urged that my argument
goes beyond the democratic scheme and
lodges against government itself. There is, I
believe, some cogency in the caveat. All government,
whatever its form, is carried on chiefly
by men whose first concern is for their offices,
not for their obligations. It is, in its essence,
a conspiracy of a small group against the masses
of men, and especially against the masses of
diligent and useful men. Its primary aim is to
keep this group in jobs that are measurably more
comfortable and exhilarating than the jobs its
members could get in free competition. They
are thus always willing to make certain sacrifices
of integrity and self-respect in order to hold
those jobs, and the fact is just as plain under
a despot as it is under the mob. The mob has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
its flatterers and bosh-mongers; the king has his
courtiers. But there is yet a difference, and I
think it is important. The courtier, at his worst,
at least performs his genuflections before one
who is theoretically his superior, and is surely
not less than his equal. He does not have to
abase himself before swine with whom, ordinarily,
he would disdain to have any traffic. He
is not compelled to pretend that he is a worse
man than he really is. He needn’t hold his nose
in order to approach his benefactor. Thus he
may go into office without having dealt his honour
a fatal wound, and once he is in, he is under
no pressure to sacrifice it further, and may nurse
it back to health and vigour. His sovereign, at
worst, has a certain respect for it, and hesitates
to strain it unduly; the mob has no sensitiveness
on that point, and, indeed, no knowledge that it
exists. The courtier’s sovereign, in other words,
is apt to be a man of honour himself. When, in
1848 or thereabout, the late Wilhelm I of Prussia
was offered the imperial crown by a so-called
parliament of his subjects, he refused it on the
ground that he could take it only from his equals,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from the sovereign princes of the <i lang="de">Reich</i>.
To the democrats of the world this attitude was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
puzzling, and on reflection it began to seem contemptible
and offensive. But that was not to be
marveled at. To a democrat any attitude based
upon a concept of honour, dignity and integrity
seems contemptible and offensive. Once Frederick
the Great was asked why he gave commissions
in his army only to <i lang="de">Junker</i>. Because, he
answered, they will not lie and they cannot be
bought. That answer explains sufficiently the
general democratic theory that the <i lang="de">Junker</i> are
not only scoundrels, but also half-wits.</p>

<p>The democratic politician, facing such plain
facts, tries to save his <i lang="fr">amour propre</i> in a characteristically
human way; that is to say, he
denies them. We all do that. We convert our
degradations into renunciations, our self-seeking
into public spirit, our swinishness into heroism.
No man, I suppose, ever admits to himself candidly
that he gets his living in a dishonourable
way, not even a Prohibition agent or a biter
off of puppies’ tails. The democratic politician,
confronted by the dishonesty and stupidity of
his master, the mob, tries to convince himself
and all the rest of us that it is really full of
rectitude and wisdom. This is the origin of the
doctrine that, whatever its transient errors, it always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
comes to right decisions in the long run.
Perhaps—but on what evidence, by what reasoning,
and for what motives! Go examine the
long history of the anti-slavery agitation in
America: it is a truly magnificent record of buncombe,
false pretences, and imbecility. This
notion that the mob is wise, I fear, is not to be
taken seriously: it was invented by mob-masters
to save their faces: there was a lot of chatter
about it by Roosevelt, but none by Washington,
and very little by Jefferson. Whenever democracy,
by an accident, produces a genuine statesman,
he is found to be proceeding on the assumption
that it is not true. And on the assumption
that it is difficult, if not impossible to go to the
mob for support, and still retain the ordinary
decencies. The best democratic statesmanship,
like the best non-democratic statesmanship,
tends to safeguard the honour of the higher
officers of state by relieving them of that degrading
necessity. As every schoolboy knows,
such was the intent of the Fathers, as expressed
in Article II, Sections 1 and 2, of the Constitution.
To this day it is a common device, when
this or that office becomes steeped in intolerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
corruption, to take it out of the gift of the mob,
and make it appointive. The aspirant, of
course, still has to seek it, for under democracy
it is very rare that office seeks the man, but seeking
it of the President, or even of the Governor
of a State, is felt to be appreciably less humiliating
and debasing than seeking it of the mob.
The President may be a Coolidge, and the Governor
may be a Blease or a Ma Ferguson, but
he (or she) is at least able to understand plain
English, and need not be put into good humour
by the arts of the circus clown or Baptist evangelist.</p>

<p>To sum up: the essential objection to feudalism
(the perfect antithesis to democracy) was
that it imposed degrading acts and attitudes upon
the vassal; the essential objection to democracy
is that, with few exceptions, it imposes degrading
acts and attitudes upon the men responsible
for the welfare and dignity of the state. The
former was compelled to do homage to his
suzerain, who was very apt to be a brute and
an ignoramus. The latter are compelled to do
homage to their constituents, who in overwhelming
majority are certain to be both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>


<h3 id="toclink_122">7.</h3>

<p><i>The Maker of Laws</i></p>

<p>In the United States, the general democratic
tendency to crowd competent and self-respecting
men out of the public service is exaggerated by
a curious constitutional rule, unknown in any
other country. This is the rule, embodied in
Article I, Sections 2 and 3, of the Constitution
and carried over into most of the State constitutions,
that a legislator must be an actual
resident of the district he represents. Its obvious
aim is to preserve for every electoral unit
a direct and continuous voice in the government;
its actual effect is to fill all the legislative bodies
of the land with puerile local politicians, many
of them so stupid that they are quite unable to
grasp the problems with which government has
to deal. In England it is perfectly possible for
the remotest division to choose a Morley to represent it,
and this, in fact, until the recent rise
of the mob, was not infrequently done. But in
the United States every congressional district
must find its representative within its own borders,
and only too often there is no competent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
man available. Even if one happens to live
there—which in large areas of the South and
many whole States of the newer West, is extremely
improbable—he is usually so enmeshed
in operations against the resident imbeciles and
their leaders, and hence so unpopular, that his
candidacy is out of the question. This is manifestly
the case in such States as Tennessee and
Mississippi. Neither is without civilized inhabitants,
but in neither is it possible to find
a civilized inhabitant who is not under the ban
of the local Fundamentalist clergy, and <em>per
corollary</em>, of the local politicians. Thus both
States, save for occasional accidents, are represented
in Congress by delegations of pliant and
unconscionable jackasses, and their influence
upon national legislation is extremely evil. It
was the votes of such ignoble fellows, piling in
from all the more backward States, that forced
the Eighteenth Amendment through both Houses
of Congress, and it was the votes of even more
degraded noodles, assembled from the backwoods
in the State Legislatures, that put the
amendment into the Constitution.</p>

<p>If it were possible for a congressional district
to choose any man to represent it, as is the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
in all other civilized countries, there would be
more breaks in the monotony of legislative venality
and stupidity, for even the rustic mob, in
the absence of strong local antipathies, well
fanned by demagogues, might succumb occasionally
to the magic of a great name. Thus a
Roscoe Pound might be sent to Congress from
North Dakota or Nevada, though it is obvious
that he could not be sent from the Massachusetts
district in which he lives, wherein his independence
and intelligence are familiar and hence offensive
to his neighbours. But this is forbidden
by the constitutional rule, and so North Dakota
and Nevada, with few if any first-rate men in
them, must turn to such men as they have. The
result everywhere is the election of a depressing
gang of incompetents, mainly petty lawyers and
small-town bankers. The second result is a
House of Representatives that, in intelligence, information
and integrity, is comparable to a gang
of bootleggers—a House so deficient in competent
leaders that it can scarcely carry on its business.
The third result is the immense power of
such corrupt and sinister agencies as the Anti-Saloon
League: a Morley would disdain its mandates,
but Congressman John J. Balderdash is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
only too eager to earn its support at home. A
glance through the Congressional Directory,
which prints autobiographies (often full of voluptuous
self-praise) of all Congressmen, is
enough to show what scrub stock is in the Lower
House. The average Southern member, for example,
runs true to a standard type. He got his
early education in a hedge school, he proceeded
to some preposterous Methodist or Baptist college,
and then he served for a time as a schoolteacher
in his native swamps, finally reaching
the dignity of county superintendent of schools
and meanwhile reading law. Admitted to the
bar, and having got a taste of county politics as
superintendent, he became district attorney, and
perhaps, after a while, county judge. Then he
began running for Congress, and after three or
four vain attempts, finally won a seat. The unfitness
of such a man for the responsibilities of
a law-maker must be obvious. He is an ignoramus,
and he is quite without the common
decencies. Having to choose between sense and
nonsense, he chooses nonsense almost instinctively.
Until he got to Washington, and began
to meet lobbyists, bootleggers and the correspondents
of the newspapers, he had perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
never met a single intelligent human being. As
a Congressman, he remains below the salt. Officialdom
disdains him; he is kept waiting in
anterooms by all the fourth assistant secretaries.
When he is invited to a party, it is a sign that
police sergeants are also invited. He must be
in his second or third term before the ushers at
the White House so much as remember his face.
His dream is to be chosen to go on a congressional
junket, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, on a drunken holiday at government
expense. His daily toil is getting jobs
for relatives and retainers. Sometimes he puts
a dummy on the pay-roll and collects the
dummy’s salary himself. In brief, a knavish
and preposterous nonentity, half way between a
kleagle of the Ku Klux and a grand worthy
bow-wow of the Knights of Zoroaster. It is such
vermin who make the laws of the United States.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of the Upper House are measurably
better, if only because they serve for
longer terms. A Congressman, with his two-year
term, is constantly running for re-election.
Scarcely has he got to Washington before he
must hurry home and resume his bootlicking of
the local bosses. But a Senator, once sworn in,
may safely forget them for two or three years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
and so, if there is no insuperable impediment in
his character, he may show a certain independence,
and yet survive. Moreover, he is usually
safer than a Congressman, even as his term ends,
for his possession of a higher office shows that he
is no inconsiderable boss himself. Thus there
are Senators who attain to a laudable mastery
of the public business, particularly such as lies
within the range of their private interests, and
even Senators who show the intellectual dignity
and vigour of genuine statesmen. But they are
surely not numerous. The average Senator, like
the average Congressman, is simply a party hack,
without ideas and without anything rationally
describable as self-respect. His backbone has a
sweet resiliency; he knows how to clap on false
whiskers; it is quite impossible to forecast his
action, even on a matter of the highest principle,
without knowing what rewards are offered by the
rival sides. Two of the most pretentious Senators,
during the Sixty-Ninth Congress, were the
gentlemen from Pennsylvania: one of them, indeed,
was the successor to the lamented Henry
Cabot Lodge as the intellectual snob of the Upper
House. Yet both, under pressure, performed
such dizzy flops that even the Senate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
gasped. It was amusing, but there was also a
touch of pathos in it. Here were men who
plainly preferred their jobs to their dignity.
Here, in brief, were men whose private rectitude
had yielded to political necessity—the eternal
tragedy of democracy. I turn to the testimony
of a Senator who stands out clearly from the
rest: the able and uncompromisingly independent
Reed of Missouri. This is what he said of his
colleagues, to their faces, on June 2, 1924:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The pending measure] will be voted for by
cowards who would rather hang on to their present
offices than serve their country or defend its Constitution.
It would not receive a vote in this body
were there not many individuals looking over their
shoulders toward the ballot-boxes of November, their
poltroon souls aquiver with apprehension lest they
may pay the price of courageous duty by the loss
of the votes of some <em>bloc</em>, clique, or coterie backing
this infamous proposal. My language may seem brutal.
If so, it is because it lays on the blistering
truth.</p>
</div>

<p>Senator Reed, in this startling characterization
of his fellow Senators, plainly violated the
rules of the Senate, which forbid one member
to question the motives of another. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
was no Senator present that day who cared to
invoke those rules. They all knew that Reed
told the truth. Their answer to him was to slink
into the cloak-rooms, and leave him to roar at
the Vice-President and the clerks. He not only
described the Senate accurately; he also described
the whole process of law-making under
democracy. Our laws are invented, in the main,
by frauds and fanatics, and put upon the statute
books by poltroons and scoundrels.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_129">8.</h3>

<p><i>The Rewards of Virtue</i></p>

<p>I have spoken of the difficulties confronting an
intelligent and honourable man who aspires to
public office under this system. If he succeeds,
it is only by a suspension of natural laws, and
his success is seldom more than transient: his
first term is commonly his last. And if, favoured
by luck again, he goes on, it is only in
the face of opposition of an almost incredible
bitterness. The case of the Senator I have just
mentioned is aptly in point. He is a man of obvious
ability and integrity, but in his last campaign
in Missouri he was opposed by a combination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of all the parties and all their factions, with
the waspish ghost of the late Dr. Wilson hanging
over the battlefield. It was only his own amazing
talents as a popular orator, aided by the
post-war <i>Katzenjammer</i> and a local delight in
vigorous, rough-and-ready-fighters, that overcame
the tremendous odds against him. In most
other American States he would have been defeated
easily; in many of them his defeat would
have been overwhelming. Only in the newer
States and in the border States have such men
any chance at all. Where party fidelity has
run strong for years they are barred from public
life completely. No Senator of any genuine
dignity and ability could come out of the Georgia
of to-day, and none could come out of the Vermont.
Such States must be content with party
hacks, and the country as a whole must submit to
their depressing imbecilities and ignoble contortions.
All of them are men who have trimmed
and fawned. All of them are forbidden a
frank and competent discussion of most of the
principal issues facing the nation.</p>

<p>But there is something yet worse, and that is
the assumption of his cowardice and venality
that lies upon even the most honourable man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
brought into public office by a miracle. The
mob is quite unable to grasp the concept of
honour, and that incapacity is naturally shared
by the vast majority of politicians. Thus the
acts of a public man of genuine rectitude are
almost always ascribed, under democracy, to
sordid and degrading motives, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, to the sort
of motives that would animate his more orthodox
colleagues if they were capable of his acts. I
believe that the fact is more potent in keeping
decent men out of public life in the United
States than even the practical difficulties that I
have rehearsed, and that it is mainly responsible
for the astounding timorousness of our politics.
Its effects were brilliantly displayed during the
final stages of the battle over the Eighteenth
Amendment. The Prohibitionist leaders, being
mainly men of wide experience in playing upon
the prejudices and emotions of the mob, developed
a technique of terrorization that was almost
irresistible. The moment a politician ventured
to speak against them he was accused of the
grossest baseness. It was whispered that he was
a secret drunkard and eager to safeguard his
tipple; it was covertly hinted that he was in the
pay of the Whiskey Ring, the Beer Trust, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
some other such bugaboo. The event showed
that the shoe was actually on the other foot—that
many of the principal supporters of Prohibition
were on the pay-roll of the Anti-Saloon
League, and that judges, attorneys-general and
other high officers of justice afterward joined
them there. But the accusations served their
purpose. The plain people, unable to imagine
a man entering public life with any other motive
than that which would have moved them themselves
if they had been in his boots—that is to
say, unable to imagine any other motive save a
yearning for private advantage—reacted to the
charges as if they had been proved, and so more
than one man of relatively high decency, as
decency goes in American life, was driven out
of office. Upon those who escaped the lesson
was not lost. It was five or six years before
any considerable faction of politicians mustered
up courage enough to defy the Prohibitionists,
and even then what animated them was not any
positive access of resolution but simply the fact
that the Anti-Saloon League was obviously far
gone in corruption, with some of its chief agents
in revolt against its methods, and others in prison
for grave crimes and misdemeanours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>I am, myself, not cursed with the itch for public
office, but I have been engaged for years in
the discussion of public questions, and so I may
be forgiven, I hope, for intruding my own experience
here. That experience may be described
briefly: there has never been a time when,
attacking this or that current theory, I have not
been accused of being in the pay of its interested
opponents, and I believe that there has
never been a time when this accusation was not
generally believed. Years ago, when the Prohibitionists
were first coming to power, they
charged me with taking money from the brewers
and distillers, and to-day they charge me with
some sort of corrupt arrangement with the bootleggers,
despite the plain fact that the latter are
not their opponents at all, but their allies. The
former accusation seemed so plausible to most
Americans that even the brewers finally gave it
credit: they actually offered to put me on their
pay-roll, and were vastly surprised when I declined.
It was simply impossible for them, as
low-caste Americans, to imagine a man attempting
to discharge a public duty disinterestedly;
they believed that I had to be paid, as their rapidly
dwindling <em>bloc</em> of Congressmen had to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
paid. So in all other directions. When, fifteen
or twenty years ago, I began exposing the
quackeries of osteopaths, chiropractors and other
such frauds, they resorted instantly to the device
of accusing me of taking a retainer from the
mythical Medical Trust, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from such men as
the Mayo brothers, Dr. George Crile, and the
faculty of the Johns Hopkins. Later on, venturing
to denounce the nefarious political activity
of the Methodist Church, and of its ally, the Ku
Klux Klan, I was accused by spokesmen for the
former of receiving bribes from the Vatican.
The comstocks went even further. When I protested
against their sinister and dishonest censorship
of literature, they charged me publicly
with being engaged in the circulation of pornography,
and actually made a vain and ill-starred
attempt to railroad me to jail on that charge.</p>

<p>The point is that such accusations are generally
believed, especially when they are leveled
at a candidate for office. The average American
knows what he would do in like case, and
he believes quite naturally that every other man
is willing and eager to do the same. At the start
of my bout with the comstocks, just mentioned,
many American newspapers assumed as a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
of course that I was guilty as charged, and some
of them, having said so, were forced into elaborate
explanations afterward to purge themselves
of libel. Of the rest, most concluded that the
whole combat was a sham battle, provoked on my
own motion to give me what they regarded as
profitable publicity. When I speak of newspapers,
of course, I speak of concrete men, their
editors. These editors, under democracy, constitute
an extremely powerful class. Their very
lack of sound knowledge and genuine intelligence
gives them a special fitness for influencing
the mob, and it is augmented by their happy
obtuseness to notions of honour. Their daily
toil consists in part of praising men and ideas
that are obviously fraudulent, and in part of denouncing
men and ideas that are respected by
their betters. The typical American editor, save
in a few of the larger towns, may be described
succinctly as one who has written a million words
in favour of Coolidge and half a million against
Darwin. He is, like the politician, an adept
trimmer and flatterer. His job is far more to
him than his self-respect. It must be plain that
the influence of such men upon public affairs
is generally evil—that their weight is almost always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
thrown against the public man of dignity
and courage—that such a public man cannot
hope to be understood by them, or to get any
useful support from them. Even when they
are friendly they are apt to be so for preposterous
and embarrassing reasons. Thus they give
their aid to the sublime democratic process of
eliminating all sense and decency from public
life. Coming out of the mob, they voice the
ideas of the mob. The first of those ideas is that
a fraud is somehow charming and reassuring—in
the common phrase, that he is a regular fellow.
The second is that an honest and candid man is
dangerous—or, perhaps more accurately, that
there is no such animal.</p>

<p>The newspaper editor who rises above this
level encounters the same incredulous hostility
from his fellows and his public that is encountered
by the superior politician, cast into public
life by accident. If he is not dismissed at once
as what is now called a Bolshevik, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, one harbouring
an occult and unintelligible yearning to
put down the Republic and pull God off His
throne, he is assumed to be engaged in
some nefarious scheme of personal aggrandizement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
I point, as examples, to the cases
of Fremont Older, of San Francisco, and
Julian Harris, of Columbus, Ga., two honest,
able and courageous men, and both opposed by
the vast majority of their colleagues. The democratic
process, indeed, is furiously inimical to
all honourable motives. It favours the man who
is without them, and it puts heavy burdens upon
the man who has them. Going further, it is
even opposed to mere competence. The public
servant who masters his job gains nothing
thereby. His natural impatience with the incapacity
and slacking of his fellows makes them
his implacable enemies, and he is viewed with
suspicion by the great mass of democrats. But
here I enter upon a subject already discussed at
length by a competent French critic, the late
Emile Faguet, of the French Academy, who gave
a whole book to it, translated into English as
“The Cult of Incompetence.” Under democracy,
says Faguet, the business of law-making
becomes a series of panics—government by orgy
and orgasm. And the public service becomes
a mere refuge for prehensile morons—get yours,
and run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>


<h3 id="toclink_138">9.</h3>

<p><i>Footnote on Lame Ducks</i></p>

<p>Faguet makes no mention of one of the curious
and unpleasant by-products of democracy, of
great potency for evil in both England and the
United States: perhaps, for some unknown reason,
it is less a nuisance in France. I allude to
the sinister activity of professional politicians
who, in the eternal struggle for office and its rewards,
have suffered crushing defeats, and are
full of rage and bitterness. All politics, under
democracy, resolves itself into a series of dynastic
questions: the objective is always the job, not
the principle. The defeated candidate commonly
takes his failure very badly, for it leaves
him stripped bare. In most cases his fellow
professionals take pity on him and put him into
some more or less gaudy appointive office, to
preserve his livelihood and save his face: the
Federal commissions that harass the land are
full of such lame ducks, and they are not unknown
on the Federal bench. But now and then
there appears one whose wounds are too painful
to be assuaged by such devices, or for whom no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
suitable office can be found. This majestic victim
not infrequently seeks surcease by a sort of
running amok. That is to say, he turns what
remains of his influence with the mob into a
weapon against the nation as a whole, and becomes
a chronic maker of trouble. The names
of Burr, Clay, Calhoun, Douglas, Blaine, Greeley,
Frémont, Roosevelt and Bryan will occur
to every attentive student of American history.
There have been many similar warlocks on lower
levels; they are familiar in the politics of every
American county.</p>

<p>Clay, like Bryan after him, was three times
a candidate for the Presidency. Defeated in
1824, 1832 and 1840, he turned his back upon
democracy, and became the first public agent
and attorney for what are now called the Interests.
When he died he was the darling of the
Mellons, Morgans and Charlie Schwabs of his
time. He believed in centralization and in the
blessings of a protective tariff. These blessings
the American people still enjoy. Calhoun, deprived
of the golden plum by an unappreciative
country, went even further. He seems to have
come to the conclusion that its crime made it
deserve capital punishment. At all events, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
threw his strength into the plan to break up the
Union. The doctrine of Nullification owed more
to him than it owed to any other politician, and
after 1832, when his hopes of getting into the
White House were finally extinguished, he devoted
himself whole-heartedly to preparing the
way for the Civil War. He was more to blame
for that war, in all probability, than any other
man. But if he had succeeded Jackson the
chances are that he would have sung a far less
bellicose tune. The case of Burr is so plain that
it has even got into the school history-books. If
he had beaten Jefferson in 1800 there would
have been no duel with Hamilton, no conspiracy
with Blennerhassett, no trial for treason, and no
long exile and venomous repining. Burr was
an able man, as politicians go under democracy,
and the young Republic stood in great need of
his peculiar talents. But his failure to succeed
Adams made a misanthrope of him, and his
misanthropy was vented upon his country, and
more than once brought it to the verge of disaster.</p>

<p>There have been others like him in our own
time: Blaine, Frémont, Hancock, Roosevelt,
Bryan. If Blaine had been elected in 1876 he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
would have ceased to wave the bloody shirt; as
it was, he was still waving it, recklessly and obscenely,
in 1884. No man laboured more assiduously
to keep alive the hatreds flowing out
of the Civil War; his whole life was poisoned
by his failure to reach the White House, and
his dreadful cramps and rages led him into a
long succession of obviously anti-social acts.
Roosevelt went the same route. His débâcle in
1912 converted him into a sort of political
killer, and until the end of his life he was constantly
on the warpath, looking for heads to
crack. The outbreak of the World War in 1914
brought him great embarrassment, for he had
been the most ardent American exponent, for
years past, of what was then generally regarded
as the German scheme of things. For a few
weeks he was irresolute, and seemed likely to
stick to his guns. But then, perceiving a chance
to annoy and damage his successful enemy, Wilson,
he swallowed the convictions of a lifetime,
and took the other side. That his ensuing uproars
had evil effects must be manifest. Regardless
of the consequences, either at home or
abroad, he kept on arousing the mob against
Wilson, and in the end he helped more than any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
other man to force the United States into the
war. His aim, it quickly appeared, was to turn
the situation to his own advantage: he made desperate
and shameless efforts to get a high military
command at the front—a post for which
he was plainly unfitted. When Wilson, still
smarting from his attack, vetoed this scheme, he
broke into fresh rages, and the rest of his life
was more pathological than political. The fruits
of his reckless demagogy are still with us.</p>

<p>Bryan was even worse. His third defeat, in
1908, convinced even so vain a fellow that the
White House was beyond his reach, and so he
consecrated himself to reprisals upon those who
had kept him out of it. He saw very clearly
who they were: the more intelligent minority
of his countrymen. It was their unanimous opposition
that had thrice thrown the balance
against him. Well, he would now make them infamous.
He would raise the mob, which still
admired him, against everything they regarded
as sound sense and intellectual decency. He
would post them as sworn foes to all true virtue
and true religion, and try, if possible, to put
them down by law. There ensued his frenzied
campaign against the teaching of evolution—perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
the most gross attack upon human dignity
and decorum ever made by a politician,
even under democracy, in modern times. Those
who regarded him, in his last years, as a mere
religious fanatic were far in error. It was not
fanaticism that moved him, but hatred. He was
an ambulent boil, as anyone could see who encountered
him face to face. His theological
ideas were actually very vague; he was quite
unable to defend them competently under Clarence
Darrow’s cross-examination. What moved
him was simply his colossal lust for revenge
upon those he held to be responsible for his downfall
as a politician. He wanted to hurt them,
proscribe them; if possible, destroy them. To
that end he was willing to sacrifice everything
else, including the public tranquillity and the
whole system of public education. He passed
out of life at last at a temperature of 110 degrees,
his eyes rolling horribly toward 1600
Pennsylvania avenue, N.W. and its leaky copper
roof. In the suffering South his fever lives after
him. The damage he did was greater than that
done by Sherman’s army.</p>

<p>Countries under the hoof of despotism escape
such lamentable exhibitions of human frailty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Unsuccessful aspirants for the crown are either
butchered out of hand or exiled to Paris, where
tertiary lues quickly disposes of them. The
Crown Prince, of course, has his secret thoughts,
and no doubt they are sometimes homicidal, but
he is forced by etiquette to keep them to himself,
and so the people are not annoyed and injured
by them. He cannot go about praying publicly
that the King, his father, come down with endocarditis,
nor can he denounce the old gentleman
as an idiot and advocate his confinement
in a <i lang="fr">maison de santé</i>. Everyone, of course,
knows what his hopes and yearnings are, but no
one has to listen to them. If he voices them at
all it is only to friendly and discreet members
of the diplomatic corps and to the ladies of the
half and quarter worlds. Under democracy,
they are bellowed from every stump.</p>

<p><i>The Will to Peace</i></p>

<p>Whenever the liberties of <i>Homo vulgaris</i> are
invaded and made a mock of in a gross and contemptuous
manner, as happened, for example,
in the United States during the reign of Wilson,
Palmer, Burleson and company, there are always
observers who marvel that he bears the outrage
with so little murmuring. Such observers
only display their unfamiliarity with the elements
of democratic science. The truth is that
the common man’s love of liberty, like his love
of sense, justice and truth, is almost wholly
imaginary. As I have argued, he is not actually
happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit
alarmed, and intolerably lonely. He longs for
the warm, reassuring smell of the herd, and is
willing to take the herdsman with it. Liberty
is not a thing for such as he. He cannot enjoy
it rationally himself, and he can think of it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
others only as something to be taken away from
them. It is, when it becomes a reality, the exclusive
possession of a small and disreputable
minority of men, like knowledge, courage and
honour. A special sort of man is needed to
understand it, nay, to stand it—and he is inevitably
an outlaw in democratic societies. The
average man doesn’t want to be free. He simply
wants to be safe.</p>

<p>Nietzsche, with his usual clarity of vision, saw
the point clearly. Liberty, he used to say, was
something that, to the general, was too cold to
be borne. Nevertheless, he apparently believed
that there was an unnatural, drug-store sort of
yearning for it in <em>all</em> men, and so he changed
Schopenhauer’s will-to-live into a will-to-power,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a will-to-free-function. Here he went too
far, and in the wrong direction: he should have
made it, on the lower levels, a will-to-peace.
What the common man longs for in this world,
before and above all his other longings, is the
simplest and most ignominious sort of peace—the
peace of a trusty in a well-managed penitentiary.
He is willing to sacrifice everything
else to it. He puts it above his dignity and he
puts it above his pride. Above all, he puts it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
above his liberty. The fact, perhaps, explains
his veneration for policemen, in all the forms
they take—his belief that there is a mysterious
sanctity in law, however absurd it may be in
fact. A policeman is a charlatan who offers,
in return for obedience, to protect him (<i>a</i>) from
his superiors, (<i>b</i>) from his equals, and (<i>c</i>) from
himself. This last service, under democracy,
is commonly the most esteemed of them all. In
the United States, at least theoretically, it is
the only thing that keeps ice-wagon drivers,
Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. secretaries, insurance collectors and
other such human camels from smoking opium,
ruining themselves in the night clubs, and going
to Palm Beach with Follies girls. It is a democratic
invention.</p>

<p>Here, though the common man is deceived,
he starts from a sound premiss: to wit, that liberty
is something too hot for his hands—or, as
Nietzsche put it, too cold for his spine. Worse,
he sees in it something that is a weapon against
him in the hands of his enemy, the man of superior
kidney. Be true to your nature, and follow
its teachings: this Emersonian counsel, it must
be manifest, offers an embarrassing support to
every variety of the <i lang="fr">droit de seigneur</i>. The history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of democracy is a history of efforts to force
successive minorities to be <em>un</em>true to their nature.
Democracy, in fact, stands in greater peril of
the free spirit than any sort of despotism ever
heard of. The despot, at least, is always safe
in one respect: his own belief in himself cannot
be shaken. But democracies may be demoralized
and run amok, and so they are in vast dread
of heresy, as a Sunday-school superintendent is
in dread of scarlet women, light wines and beer,
and the unreadable works of Charles Darwin.
It would be unimaginable for a democracy to
submit serenely to such gross dissents as Frederick
the Great not only permitted, but even encouraged.
Once the mob is on the loose, there
is no holding it. So the subversive minority
must be reduced to impotence; the heretic must
be put down.</p>

<p>If, as they say, one of the main purposes of
all civilized government is to preserve and augment
the liberty of the individual, then surely
democracy accomplishes it less efficiently than
any other form. Is the individual worth thinking
of at all? Then the superior individual is
worth more thought than his inferiors. But it is
precisely the superior individual who is the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
victim of the democratic process. It not only
tries to regulate his acts; it also tries to delimit
his thoughts; it is constantly inventing new forms
of the old crime of imagining the King’s death.
The Roman <i lang="fr">lex de majestate</i> was put upon the
books, not by an emperor, nor even by a consul,
but by Saturninus, a tribune of the people. Its
aim was to protect the state against aristocrats,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, against free spirits, each holding himself
answerable only to his own notions. The aim
of democracy is to break all such free spirits to
the common harness. It tries to iron them out,
to pump them dry of self-respect, to make docile
John Does of them. The measure of its success
is the extent to which such men are brought
down, and made common. The measure of
civilization is the extent to which they resist and
survive. Thus the only sort of liberty that is
real under democracy is the liberty of the have-nots
to destroy the liberty of the haves.</p>

<p>This liberty is supposed, in some occult way,
to enhance human dignity. Perhaps, in one
of its aspects, it actually does. The have-not
gains something valuable when he acquires the
delusion that he is the equal of his betters. It
may not be true—but even a delusion, if it augments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the dignity of man, is something. Certain
apparent realities grow out of it: the peasant
no longer pulls his forelock when he meets
the baron, he is free to sue and be sued, he may
denounce Huxley as a quack. But the thing,
alas, works both ways. As one pan of the scale
goes up, the other comes down. If democracy
really loves the dignity of man, then it kills the
thing it loves. Where it prevails, not even the
King can be dignified in any rational sense: he
becomes Harding, jabbering of normalcy, or
Coolidge, communing with his preposterous
<i lang="af">Tabakparlement</i> around the stove. Nor the
Pope: he becomes a Methodist bishop in a natty
business-suit, and with a toothbrush moustache.
Nor the Generalissimo: he becomes Pershing,
haranguing Rotary, and slapping the backs of
his fellow Elks.</p>

<p><i>The Democrat as Moralist</i></p>

<p>Liberty gone, there remains the majestic phenomenon
of democratic law. A glance at it is
sufficient to show the identity of democracy and
Puritanism. The two, indeed, are but different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
facets of the same gem. In the psyche they are
one. For both get their primal essence out of
the inferior man’s fear and hatred of his betters,
born of his observation that, for all his fine
theories, they are stronger and of more courage
than he is, and that as they go through this dreadful
world they have a far better time. Thus
envy comes in; if you overlook it you will never
understand democracy, and you will never understand
Puritanism. It is not, of course, a
speciality of democratic man. It is the common
possession of all men of the ignoble and
incompetent sort, at all times and everywhere.
But it is only under democracy that it is liberated;
it is only under democracy that it becomes
the philosophy of the state. What the human
race owes to the old autocracies, and how little,
in these democratic days, it is disposed to remember
the debt! Their service, perhaps, was
a by-product of a purpose far afield, but it was
a service none the less: they held the green fury
of the mob in check, and so set free the spirit
of superior man. Their collapse under Flavius
Honorius left Europe in chaos for four hundred
years. Their revival under Charlemagne made
the Renaissance possible, and the modern age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
What the thing was that they kept from the throat
of civilization has been shown more than once
in these later days, by the failure of their enfeebled
successors. I point to the only too obvious
examples of the French and Russian Revolutions.
The instant such a catastrophe liberates
the mob, it begins a war to the death upon superiority
of every kind—not only upon the kind
that naturally attaches to autocracy, but even
upon the kind that stands in opposition to it.
The day after a successful revolution is a blue
day for the late autocrat, but it is also a blue day
for every other superior man. The murder of
Lavoisier was a phenomenon quite as significant
as the murder of Louis XVI. We need no
scientists in France, shouted MM. of the Revolutionary
Tribunal. Wat Tyler, four centuries
before, reduced it to an even greater frankness
and simplicity: he hanged every man who confessed
to being able to read and write.</p>

<p>Democracy, as a political scheme, may be defined
as a device for releasing this hatred born
of envy, and for giving it the force and dignity
of law. Tyler, in the end, was dispatched by
Walworth; under democracy he becomes almost
the ideal Good Man. It is very difficult to disentangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the political ideas of this anthropoid
Good Man from his theological ideas: they constantly
overlap and coalesce, and the democratic
state, despite the contrary example of France,
almost always shows a strong tendency to be
also a Puritan state. Puritan legislation, especially
in the field of public law, is a thing of
many grandiose pretensions and a few simple
and ignoble realities. The Puritan, discussing
it voluptuously, always tries to convince himself
(and the rest of us) that it is grounded upon altruistic
and evangelical motives—that its aim is
to work the other fellow’s benefit against the
other fellow’s will. Such is the theory behind
Prohibition, comstockery, vice crusading, and
all its other familiar devices of oppression.
That theory, of course, is false. The Puritan’s
actual motives are (<i>a</i>) to punish the other
fellow for having a better time in the world, and
(<i>b</i>) to bring the other fellow down to his own
unhappy level. Such are his punitive and remedial
purposes. Primarily, he is against every
human act that he is incapable of himself—safely.
The adverb tells the whole story. The
Puritan is surely no ascetic. Even in the great
days of the New England theocracy it was impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
to restrain his libidinousness: his eyes
rolled sideways at buxom wenches quite as often
as they rolled upward to God. But he is incapable
of sexual experience upon what may be
called a civilized plane; it is impossible for him
to manage the thing as a romantic adventure; in
his hands it reduces itself to the terms of the barnyard.
Hence the Mann Act. So with dalliance
with the grape. He can have experience of it
only as a furtive transaction behind the door,
with a dreadful headache to follow. Hence
Prohibition. So, again, with the joys that come
out of the fine arts. Looking at a picture, he
sees only the model’s pudenda. Reading a book,
he misses the ordeals and exaltations of the
spirit, and remembers only the natural functions.
Hence comstockery.</p>

<p>His delight in his own rectitude is grounded
upon a facile assumption that it is difficult to
maintain—that the other fellow, being deficient
in God’s grace, is incapable of it. So he venerates
himself, in the moral department, as an
artist of unusual talents, a virtuoso of virtue.
His error consists in mistaking a weakness for
a merit, an inferiority for a superiority. It is
not actually a sign of spiritual eminence to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
moral in the Puritan sense: it is simply a sign
of docility, of lack of enterprise and originality,
of cowardice. The Puritan, once his mainly
imaginary triumphs over the flesh and the devil
are forgotten, always turns out to be a poor stick
of a man—in brief, a natural democrat. His
triumphs in the field of government are as illusory
as his triumphs as metaphysician and artist.
No Puritan has ever painted a picture
worth looking at, or written a symphony worth
hearing, or a poem worth reading—and I am not
forgetting John Milton, who was not a Puritan
at all, but a libertarian, which is the exact opposite.
The whole Puritan literature is comprised
in “The Pilgrim’s Progress.” Even in
the department wherein the Puritan is most
proud of himself, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, that of moral legislation,
he has done only second and third rate work.
His fine schemes for bringing his betters down
to his own depressing level always turn out
badly. In the whole history of human law-making
there is no record of a failure worse than
that of Prohibition in the United States. Since
the first uprising of the lower orders, the modern
age has seen but one genuinely valuable
contribution to moral legislation: I allude, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
course, to the Code Napoléon. It was concocted
by a committee of violent anti-Puritans, and in
the full tide of a bitter reaction against democracy.</p>

<p>If democracy had not lain implicit in Puritanism,
Puritanism would have had to invent it.
Each is necessary to the other. Democracy provides
the machinery that Puritanism needs for
the quick and ruthless execution of its preposterous
inventions. Facing autocracy, it faces
insuperable difficulties, for its spokesmen can
convince the King only in case he is crazy, and
even when he is crazy he is commonly restrained
by his ministers. But the mob is easy to convince,
for what Puritanism has to say to it is
mainly what it already believes: its politics is
based upon the same brutal envies and quaking
fears that lie under the Puritan ethic. Moreover,
the political machinery through which it
functions provides a ready means of translating
such envies and fears into action. There is need
only to sound the alarm and take a vote: the
debate is over the moment the majority has
spoken. The fact explains the ferocious haste
with which, in democratic countries, even the
most strange and dubious legislative experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
are launched. Haste is necessary, lest even the
mob be shaken by sober second thought. And
haste is easy, for the appeal to the majority is
officially the last appeal of all, and when it has
been made there is the best of excuses for cutting
off debate. I have described the precise process
in a previous section. Fanatics inflame the
mob, and thereby alarm the scoundrels set up to
make laws in its name. The scoundrels precipitately
do the rest. The Fathers were not unaware
of this danger in the democratic scheme. They
sought to counteract it by establishing upper
chambers, removed by at least one degree from
the mob’s hot rages. Their precaution has been
turned to naught by depriving the upper chambers
of that prophylactic remoteness, and exposing
them to the direct and unmitigated blast.</p>

<p>It must be plain that this process of law-making
by orgy, with fanatics supplying the
motive-power and unconscionable knaves steering
the machine, is bound to fill the statute-books
with enactments that have no rational use or
value save that of serving as instruments of psychopathological
persecution and private revenge.
This is found to be the case, in fact, in almost
every American State. The grotesque anti-syndicalist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
laws of California, the anti-evolution
laws of Tennessee and Mississippi, and the acts
for the enforcement of Prohibition in Ohio and
Indiana are typical. They involve gross invasions
of the most elementary rights of the free
citizen, but they are popular with the mob because
they have a virtuous smack and provide it
with an endless succession of barbarous but
thrilling shows. Their chosen victims are men
the mob naturally envies and hates—men of unusual
intelligence and enterprise, men who regard
their constitutional liberties seriously and
are willing to go to some risk and expense to
defend them. Such men are inevitably unpopular
under democracy, for their qualities are qualities
that the mob wholly lacks, and is uneasily
conscious of lacking: it thus delights in seeing
them exposed to slander and oppression, and
railroaded to prison. There is always a district
attorney at hand to launch the prosecution,
for district attorneys are invariably men who aspire
to higher office, and no more facile way
to it is to be found than by assaulting and destroying
a man above the general. As I have
shown, many an American Congressman comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
to Washington from a district attorney’s office:
you may be sure that he is seldom promoted because
he has been jealous of the liberties of the
citizen. Many a judge reaches the bench by the
same route—and thereafter benignantly helps
along his successors. The whole criminal law in
America thus acquires a flavour of fraud. It is
constantly embellished and reinforced by fanatics
who have discovered how easy it is to hurl
missiles at their enemies and opponents from
behind ranks of policemen. It is executed by
law officers whose private prosperity runs in
direct ratio to their reckless ferocity. And the
business is applauded by morons whose chief
delight lies in seeing their betters manhandled
and humiliated. Even the ordinary criminal
law is so carried out—that is, when the accused
happens to be conspicuous enough to make it
worth while. Every district attorney in America
goes to his knees every night to ask God to deliver
a Thaw or a Fatty Arbuckle into his hands.
In the criminal courts a rich man not only enjoys
none of the advantages that Liberals and
other defenders of democracy constantly talk
of; he is under very real and very heavy burdens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
The defence that Thaw offered in the
White case would have got a taxi-driver acquitted
in five minutes. And had Arbuckle been a
waiter, no district attorney in the land would
have dreamed of putting him on trial for first-degree
murder.</p>

<p>For such foul and pestiferous proceedings, of
course, moral excuses are always offered. The
district attorney is an altruist whose one dream
is Law Enforcement; he cannot be terrified by
the power of money; he is the spokesman of the
virtuous masses against the godless and abominable
classes. The same buncombe issues from the
Prohibitionists, comstocks, hunters of Bolshevists,
and other such frauds. Its hollowness is
constantly revealed. The Prohibitionists, when
they foisted their brummagem cure-all upon the
country under cover of the war hysteria, gave
out that their advocacy of it was based upon a
Christian yearning to abate drunkenness, and
so abolish crime, poverty and disease. They
preached a millennium, and no doubt convinced
hundreds of thousands of naïve and sentimental
persons, not themselves Puritans, nor even democrats.
That millennium, as everyone knows, has
failed to come in. Not only are crime, poverty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
and disease undiminished, but drunkenness itself,
if the police statistics are to be believed,
has greatly increased. The land rocks with the
scandal. Prohibition has made the use of alcohol
devilish and even fashionable, and so vastly
augmented the number of users. The young
of both sexes, mainly innocent of the cup under
license, now take to it almost unanimously. In
brief, Prohibition has not only failed to work
the benefits that its proponents promised in 1917;
it has brought in so many new evils that even
the mob has turned against it. But do the Prohibitionists
admit the fact frankly, and repudiate
their original nonsense? They do not. On the
contrary, they keep on demanding more and
worse enforcement statutes—that is to say, more
and worse devices for harassing and persecuting
their opponents. The more obvious the failure
becomes, the more shamelessly they exhibit their
genuine motives. In plain words, what moves
them is the psychological aberration called sadism.
They lust to inflict inconvenience, discomfort,
and, whenever possible, disgrace upon the
persons they hate—which is to say, upon everyone
who is free from their barbarous theological
superstitions, and is having a better time in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
world than they are. They cannot stop the use
of alcohol, nor even appreciably diminish it, but
they <em>can</em> badger and annoy everyone who seeks to
use it decently, and they <em>can</em> fill the jails with
men taken for purely artificial offences, and they
<em>can</em> get satisfaction thereby for the Puritan
yearning to browbeat and injure, to torture and
terrorize, to punish and humiliate all who show
any sign of being happy. And all this they can
do with a safe line of policemen and judges in
front of them; always they can do it without
personal risk.</p>

<p>It is this freedom from personal risk that is the
secret of the Prohibitionists’ continued frenzy,
despite the complete collapse of Prohibition itself.
They know very well that the American
mob, far from being lawless, is actually excessively
tolerant of written laws and judicial fiats,
however plainly they violate the fundamental
rights of free men, and they know that this tolerance
is sufficient to protect them from what, in
more liberal and enlightened countries, would be
the natural consequences of their anti-social activity.
If they had to meet their victims face to
face, there would be a different story to tell.
But, like their brethren, the comstocks and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
professional patriots, they seldom encounter
this embarrassment. Instead, they turn the officers
of the law to the uses of their mania.
More, they reinforce the officers of the law with
an army of bravos sworn to take their orders and
do their bidding—the army of so-called Prohibition
enforcement officers, mainly made up of
professional criminals. Thus, under democracy,
the normal, well-behaved, decent citizen—the
Forgotten Man of the late William Graham Sumner—is
beset from all sides, and every year sees
an augmentation of his woes. In order to satisfy
the envy and hatred of his inferiors and the blood
lust of a pack of irresponsible and unconscionable
fanatics, few of them of any dignity as citizens
or as men and many of them obviously
hypocritical and corrupt, this decent citizen is
converted into a criminal for performing acts
that are natural to men of his class everywhere,
and police and courts are degraded to the abhorrent
office of punishing him for them. Certainly
it should not be surprising that such degrading
work has greatly diminished the authority of
both—that Prohibition has made the courts disreputable
and increased general crime. A judge
who jails a well-disposed and inoffensive citizen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
for violating an unjust and dishonest law may
be defended plausibly, perhaps, by legal casuistry,
but it is very hard to make out a case for
him as a self-respecting man. Like the ordinary
politician, he puts his job above his professional
dignity and his common decency. More than
one judge, unable to square such loathsome
duties with his private notions of honor, has
stepped down from the bench, and left the business
to a successor who was more a lawyer and
less a man.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_166">3.</h3>

<p><i>Where Puritanism Fails</i></p>

<p>Under the pressure of fanaticism, and with
the mob complacently applauding the show,
democratic law tends more and more to be
grounded upon the maxim that every citizen is,
by nature, a traitor, a libertine, and a scoundrel.
In order to dissuade him from his evil-doing the
police power is extended until it surpasses anything
ever heard of in the oriental monarchies
of antiquity. In many American States—for
example, California and Pennsylvania—it is almost
a literal fact that the citizen has no rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
that the police are bound to respect. These awful
powers, of course, are not exercised against
<em>all</em> citizens. The man of influence with the
reigning politicians, the supporter of the prevailing
delusions, and the adept hypocrite—these are
seldom molested. But the man who finds himself
in an unpopular minority is at the mercy of
the <i lang="de">Polizei</i>, and the easiest way to get into such a
minority is to speak out boldly for the Bill of
Rights. Men have been clubbed and jailed in
Pennsylvania for merely mentioning it; scores
have been jailed for protesting publicly against
its violation. Here the attack was at least frank,
and, to that extent, honest; more often it is made
disingenuously, and to the tune of pious snuffling.
First an unpopular man is singled out for persecution,
and then a diligent search is made, with
the police and prosecuting officers and even the
courts co-operating, for a law that he can be
accused of breaking. The enormous multiplicity
of sumptuary and inquisitorial statutes makes
this quest easy. The prisoner begins his progress
through the mill of justice under a vague
accusation of disorderly conduct or disturbing
the peace; he ends charged with crimes that
carry staggering penalties. There are statutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
in many States, notably California, that explore
his mind, and lay him by the heels for merely
thinking unpopular thoughts. Once he is accused
of such heresy, the subsequent proceedings
take on the character of a lynching. His constitutional
rights are swept away as of no validity,
and all the ancient rules of the Common
Law—for example, those against double jeopardy
and hearsay—are suspended in order to
fetch him. Many of the newer statutes actually
suspend these safeguards formally, and though
they are to that extent plainly unconstitutional,
the higher courts have not interfered with their
execution. The Volstead Act, for instance, destroys
the constitutional right to a jury trial, and
in its administration the constitutional prohibition
of unreasonable searches and seizures and
the rule against double jeopardy are habitually
violated. But no protest comes save from
specialists in liberty, most of whom are so busy
keeping out of jail themselves that their caveats
are feeble and ineffective. The mob is always
in favour of the prosecution, for the prosecution
is giving the show. In the face of its applause,
very few American judges have the courage to
enforce the constitutional guarantees—and still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
fewer prosecuting attorneys. As I have said, a
prosecuting attorney’s success depends very
largely upon his ferocity. American practice
permits him an extravagance of attack that would
land him in jail, and perhaps even in a lunatic
asylum, in any other country, and the more passionately
he indulges in it the more certain becomes
his promotion to higher office, including
the judicial. Perhaps a half of all American
judges, at some time or other, have been prosecuting
officers. They carry to the bench the habits
of mind acquired on the other side of the bar;
they seem to be generally convinced that any man
accused of crime is <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> guilty, and that if
he is known to harbour political heresies he is
guilty of a sort of blasphemy when he mentions
his constitutional rights.</p>

<p>This doctrine that a man who stands in contempt
of the prevailing ideology has no rights
under the law is so thoroughly democratic that
in the United States it is seldom questioned save
by romantic fanatics, robbed of their wits by an
uncritical reading of the Fathers. It not only
goes unchallenged otherwise; it is openly stated
and defended, and by high authorities. I point,
for example, to the Right Rev. Luther B. Wilson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
who, as a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, occupies an office that is both ecclesiastical
and political, and is of dignity and
puissance in both fields. Some time ago this
Wilson was invited to preach in the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine in New York—a delicate acknowledgment
of his importance by his rival
prelate of the Anglican Church, Monsignor Manning.
His sermon, in brief, was a passionate
plea for the putting down of heresy, law or no
law, Constitution or no Constitution. “Atheism,”
he declared, “is not only folly, but to the
state a traitor. It does not deserve a place and
should not be defended by any specious claim
for immunity under the constitutional guaranties
of the right of free speech.” This bloodthirsty
and astounding dictum, though it came from a
Christian ecclesiastic of a rank higher than that
attained by Christ Himself, seemed so natural
that it attracted no notice whatever. Not a single
New York newspaper challenged it; even the
Liberal weeklies let it pass as too obvious for
cavil. A week or so later it was printed with approbation
in all the Methodist denominational
organs, and since then many other bishops of
that sect have ratified it. The same doctrine is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
frequently stated plainly by high legal officers,
especially when a man accused of political
heresy is on trial—usually, of course, for an alleged
infraction of the ordinary law. As I have
said in a previous chapter, it was applied to
atheists, exactly as Bishop Wilson applied it,
during the celebrated Scopes trial at Dayton,
Tenn. Arthur Garfield Hays, defending Scopes,
arose at one point in the proceedings to protest
that they were going beyond the bounds of due
process—that his client was not getting a fair
and impartial trial within the meaning of the
Constitution. At once the prosecuting attorney
general, Stewart, answered candidly that an
atheist had no right to a fair trial in Tennessee,
and the judge on the bench, the learned Raulston,
approved with a nod. Hays, who is a
Liberal, was so overcome that he sank in
his place with a horrified gurgle, but the Tennesseans
in the courtroom saw nothing strange
in Stewart’s reply. They knew very well that,
in all the States South of the Potomac, save only
Louisiana, Catholics, Negroes and all the persons
unable to speak the local dialects fluently shared
the disability of atheists. And if they were
learned in American law, they knew that anti-Catholics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
faced the same disability in Massachusetts,
like anti-Semites in New York, and that in
every State there were classes similarly proscribed.
I do not here allude to the natural difficulty
that every man of notoriously heterodox
ideas must encounter every time he faces a jury,
which is to say, twelve men of limited information
and intelligence, chosen precisely because of
their lack of intellectual resilience. I am speaking
of the hostility he must look for in prosecuting
officers and judges, and in the newspapers
that sit in judgment upon them and largely determine
their fortunes. I am speaking of what
has come to be a settled practice in American
criminal law.</p>

<p>It is difficult, indeed, for democracy to reconcile
itself to what may be called common decency.
By this common decency I mean the
habit, in the individual, of viewing with tolerance
and charity the acts and ideas of other individuals—the
habit which makes a man a
reliable friend, a generous opponent, and a good
citizen. The democrat, despite his strong opinion
to the contrary, is seldom a good citizen. In
that sense, as in most others, he falls distressfully
short. His eagerness to bring all his fellow-citizens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and especially all those who are superior
to him, into accord with his own dull and docile
way of thinking, and to force it upon them when
they resist, leads him inevitably into acts of unfairness,
oppression and dishonour which, if all
men were alike guilty of them, would quickly
break down that mutual trust and confidence
upon which the very structure of civilized society
rests. Where democratic man is so firmly
in possession of his theoretical rights that resistance
to him is hopeless, as it is in large areas of
the United States, he actually produces this disaster.
To live in a community so cursed is almost
impossible to any man who does not accept
the democratic epistemology and the Puritan
ethic, which is to say, to any well-informed and
self-respecting man. He is harassed in so many
small ways, and with such depressing violence
and lack of decency, that he is usually compelled
to clear out. This fact, in large part, explains
the cultural collapse of New England and the
marked cultural backwardness of whole regions
in the South and Middle West. A man of sound
sense, born into the Tennessee hinterland, not
only feels lonesome as he comes to maturity;
he also feels unsafe. The morons surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
him hate him, and if they can’t lay him for mere
heresy, they will wait their chance and lay him
for burning barns, for poisoning wells, or for
taking Russian gold. So he departs.</p>

<p>This irreconcilable antagonism between democratic
Puritanism and common decency is
probably responsible for the uneasiness and unhappiness
that are so marked in American life,
despite the great material prosperity of the
United States. Theoretically, the American people
should be happier than any other; actually,
they are probably the least happy in Christendom.
The trouble with them is that they do not trust
one another—and without mutual trust there can
be no ease, and no genuine happiness. What
avails it for a man to have money in the bank
and a Ford in his garage if he knows that his
neighbours on both sides are watching him
through knotholes, and that the pastor of the
tabernacle down the road is planning to have him
sent to jail? The thing that makes life charming
is not money, but the society of our fellow men,
and the thing that draws us toward our fellow
men is not admiration for their inner virtues,
their hard striving to live according to the light
that is in them, but admiration for their outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
graces and decencies—in brief, confidence that
they will always act generously and understandingly
in their intercourse with us. We must
trust men before we may enjoy them. Manifestly,
it is impossible to put any such trust in
a Puritan. With the best intentions in the world
he cannot rid himself of the delusion that his
duty to save us from our sins—<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, from the
non-Puritanical acts that we delight in—is paramount
to his duty to let us be happy in our own
way. Thus he is unable to be tolerant, and with
tolerance goes magnanimity. A Puritan cannot
be magnanimous. He is constitutionally unable
to grasp the notion that it is better to be decent
than to be steadfast, or even than to be just. So
with the democrat, who is simply a Puritan
doubly damned. When the late Dr. Wilson, confronted
by the case of poor old silly Debs, decided
instantly that Debs must remain in jail, he
acted as a true democrat and a perfect Puritan.
The impulse to be magnanimous, to forgive and
forget, to be kindly and generous toward a misguided
and harmless old man, was overcome
by the harsh Puritan compulsion to observe the
letter of the law at all costs. Every Puritan is
a lawyer, and so is every democrat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>


<h3 id="toclink_176">4.</h3>

<p><i>Corruption Under Democracy</i></p>

<p>This moral compulsion of the Puritan and
democrat, of course, is mainly bogus. When one
has written off cruelty, envy and cowardice, one
has accounted for nine-tenths of it. Certainly
I need not argue at this late date that the <em>Ur</em>-Puritan
of New England was by no means the
vestal that his heirs and assigns think of when
they praise him. He was not only a very carnal
fellow, and given to lamentable transactions with
loose women and fiery jugs; he was also a virtuoso
of sharp practices, and to this day his
feats in that department survive in fable. Nor
is there any perceptible improvement in his successors.
When a gang of real estate agents (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
rent sweaters), bond salesman and automobile
dealers gets together to sob for Service, it takes
no Freudian to surmise that someone is about to
be swindled. The cult of Service, indeed, is
half a sop to conscience, and half a bait to catch
conies. Its cultivation in the United States runs
parallel with the most gorgeous development of
imposture as a fine art that Christendom has ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
seen. I speak of a fine art in the literal sense;
in the form of advertising it enlists such talents
as, under less pious civilizations, would be devoted
to the confection of cathedrals, and even,
perhaps, masses. A sixth of the Americano’s
income is rooked out of him by rogues who
have at him officially, and in the name of the
government; half the remainder goes to sharpers
who prefer the greater risks and greater profits
of private enterprise. All schemes to save him
from such victimizations have failed in the past,
and all of them, I believe, are bound to fail in
the future; most of the more gaudy of them are
simply devices to facilitate fresh victimizations.
For democratic man, dreaming eternally of
Utopias, is ever a prey to shibboleths, and those
that fetch him in his political capacity are more
than matched by those that fetch him in his rôle
of private citizen. His normal and natural situation,
held through all the vicissitudes of his
brief history, has been that of one who, at great
cost and effort, has sneaked home a jug of contraband
whiskey, sworn to have issued out of a
padlocked distillery, and then finds, on uncorking
it, that it is a compound of pepper, prune
juice and wood alcohol. This, in a sentence, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the history of democracy. It is, in detail, the
history of all such characteristically democratic
masterpieces as Bryanism, Ku Kluxery, and the
war to end war. They are full of virtuous pretences,
and they are unmitigated swindles.</p>

<p>All observers of democracy, from Tocqueville
to the Adams brothers and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt,
have marveled at its corruptions on the political
side, and speculated heavily as to the causes
thereof. The fact was noted in the earliest days
of the democratic movement, and Friedrich von
Gentz, who began life as an Anglomaniac, was
using it as an argument against the parliamentary
system so early as 1809. Gentz, who served
Metternich as the current Washington correspondents
serve whatever dullard happens to be
President, contended that the introduction of
democracy on the Continent would bring in a
reign of bribery, and thus destroy the integrity
and authority of the state. The proofs that he
was right were already piling up, in his day,
in the United States. They were destined to
be greatly reinforced when the Third Republic
got under way in France in 1870, and to be given
impressive support when the German Republic
set up shop in 1918. In 1919, for the first time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
since the coronation of Henry the Fowler, a German
Cabinet minister crossed the border between
days, his loot under his arm. The historians,
immersed in their closets, marvel that such
things happen, and marvel even more that democracy
takes them calmly, and even lightly. Somewhere
in “The Education of Henry Adams” you
will find an account of the gigantic peculations
that went on during the second Grant administration,
and melancholy reflections upon the populace’s
philosophic acceptance of them as inevitable,
and even natural. In our own time we
have seen the English mob embrace and elevate
to higher office the democratic statesmen caught
in the Marconi scandal, and the American mob
condone almost automatically the herculean
raids upon the Treasury that marked the Wilson
administration, and the less spectacular but even
more deliberate thievings that went on under the
martyred Harding. In the latter case it turned
upon the small body of specialists in rectitude
who ventured to protest, and in the end they
found themselves far more unpopular than the
thieves.</p>

<p>Such phenomena, as I say, puzzle the more
academic pathologists of democracy, but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
for me, I only say that they seem to be in
strict accord with God’s invariable laws. Why
should democracy rise against bribery? It is
itself a form of wholesale bribery. In place
of a government with a fixed purpose and a visible
goal, it sets up a government that is a mere
function of the mob’s vagaries, and that maintains
itself by constantly bargaining with those
vagaries. Its security depends wholly upon providing
satisfactory bribes for the prehensile minorities
that constitute the mob, or that have
managed to deceive and inflame the mob. One
day the labour leaders—a government within the
general government—must be bought with offices;
the next day the dupes of these labour
leaders must be bought with legislation, usually
of a sort loading the ordinary scales of justice
in their favour; the day after there must be
something for the manufacturers, for the Methodists,
for the Catholics, for the farmers. I have
exhibited, in another work, the fact that this last
class demands bribes pure and simple—that its
yearnings for its own private advantage are never
ameliorated by yearnings for the common good.
The whole process of government under democracy,
as everyone knows, is a process of similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
trading. The very head of the state, having no
title to his office save that which lies in the popular
will, is forced to haggle and bargain like the
lowliest office-seeker. There has been no President
of the United States since Washington who
did not go into office with a long list of promises
in his pocket, and nine-tenths of them have always
been promises of private reward from the
public store. It is surely not regarded as immoral,
by the democratic ethic, to make and execute
such promises, though statesmen of lofty
pretensions, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, Lincoln, sometimes deny having
made them. What is reproached as immoral
is making them, and then not keeping them.
When the late Dr. Wilson made William Jennings
Bryan his Secretary of State the act
brought forth only tolerant smiles, though it was
comparable to appointing a chiropractor Surgeon-General
of the Army—a feat which Dr. Harding,
a few years later, escaped performing only
by a hair. But if Wilson had forgotten his
obligation to Bryan there would have been an
outburst of moral indignation, even among
Bryan’s enemies, and the collapse of Wilson
would have come long before it did. When he
blew up at last it was not because, after promulgating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
his Fourteen Points, he joined in swindling
a helpless foe at Versailles; it was because
he tried, at Paris, to undo some of the consequences
of that fraud by forcing the United
States into the League of Nations. A democratic
state, indeed, is so firmly grounded upon
cheats and humbugs of all sorts that they inevitably
colour its dealings with other nations, and
so one always finds it regarded as a dubious
friend and a tricky foe. That the United States,
in its foreign relations, has descended to gross
deceits and tergiversations since the earliest days
of the Republic was long ago pointed out by
Lecky; it is regarded universally to-day as a
pious fraud—which is to say, as a Puritan. Nor
has England, the next most eminent democratic
state, got the name of <i lang="fr">perfide Albion</i> for nothing.
Ruled by shady men, a nation itself becomes
shady.</p>

<p>In its domestic relations, of course, the same
causes have the same effects. The government
deals with the citizens from whom it has its mandate
in a base and disingenuous manner, and
fails completely to maintain equal justice among
them. It not only follows the majority in persecuting
those who happen to be unpopular; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
also institutes persecutions of its own, and frequently
against men of the greatest rectitude and
largest public usefulness. I marvel that no
candidate for the doctorate has ever written a
realistic history of the American Department of
Justice, ironically so called. It has been engaged
in sharp practices since the earliest days,
and remains a fecund source of oppression and
corruption to-day. It is hard to recall an administration
in which it was not the centre of
grave scandal. Within our own time it has
actually resorted to perjury in its efforts to undo
men guilty of flouting it, and at all times it
has laboured valiantly to nullify the guarantees
of the Bill of Rights. The doings of
its corps of spies and <i lang="fr">agents provocateurs</i> are
worthy the pen of some confectioner of dime
novels; at one time they were employed against
the members of the two houses of Congress,
and the alarmed legislators threw them off only
by threatening to hold up their pay. As
Mill long ago pointed out, the tyranny of the
majority under democracy is not only shown in
oppressive laws, but also in a usurped power to
suspend the operation of laws that are just. In
this enterprise a democratic government always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
marches ahead of the majority. Even more
than the most absolute oriental despotism, it becomes
a government of men, not of laws. Its
favourites are, to all intents and purposes, immune
to criminal processes, whatever their offences,
and its enemies are exposed to espionage
and persecution of the most aggravated sort. It
takes advantage of every passing craze and delusion
of the mob to dispose of those who oppose
it, and it maintains a complex and highly effective
machine for launching such crazes and delusions
when the supply of them lags. Above all,
it always shows that characteristically Puritan
habit of which Brooks Adams wrote in “The
Emancipation of Massachusetts”: the habit, to
wit, of inflicting as much mental suffering as possible
upon its victims. That is to say, it not only
has at them by legal means; it also defames
them, and so seeks to ruin them doubly. The
constant and central aim of every democratic
government is to silence criticism of itself. It
begins to weaken, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the jobs of its component
rogues begin to be insecure, the instant such criticism
rises. It is thus <i lang="la">fidei defensor</i> before it is
anything else, and its whole power, legal
and extra-legal, is thrown against the sceptic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
who challenges its infallibility. Constitutional
checks have little effect upon its operations, for
the only machinery for putting them into effect
is under its control. No ruler, indeed, ever
wants to be a constitutional ruler, and least of
all the ruler whose reign has a term, and who
must make hay, in consequence, while the sun
shines. Under republics, as under constitutional
monarchies, the history of government is
a history of successive usurpations. I avoid the
banality of pointing to the cases of Lincoln and
Wilson. No man would want to be President of
the United States in strict accordance with the
Constitution. There is no sense of power in
merely executing laws; it comes from evading or
augmenting them.</p>

<p>I incline to think that this view of government
as a group of men struggling for power and
profit, in the face and at the expense of the generality
of men, has its place somewhere in the
dark recesses of the popular mind, and that it
accounts, at least in large part, for the toleration
with which public corruption is regarded in
democratic states. Democratic man, to begin
with, is corrupt himself: he will take whatever
he can safely get, law or no law. He assumes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
naturally and accurately, that the knaves and
mountebanks who govern him are of the same
kidney—in his own phrase, that they are in
public life for what there is in it. It thus
does not shock him to find them running true
to the ordinances of their nature. If, indeed,
any individual among them shows an unusual
rectitude, and refuses spectacularly to take what
might be his for the grabbing, <i>Homo boobiens</i>
sets him down as either a liar or an idiot,
and refuses to admire him. So with private
rogues who tap the communal till. Democratic
man is stupid, but he is not so stupid that
he does not see the government as a group of
men devoted to his exploitation—that is, as a
group external to his own group, and with antagonistic
interests. He believes that its central
aim is to squeeze as much out of him as he can
be forced to yield, and so he sees no immorality
in attempting a contrary squeeze when the opportunity
offers. Beating the government thus
becomes a transaction devoid of moral turpitude.
If, when it is achieved on an heroic scale by
scoundrels of high tone, a storm of public indignation
follows, the springs of that indignation
are to be found, not in virtue, but in envy. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
point of fact, it seldom follows. As I have said,
there was little if any public fury over the colossal
stealings that went on during the Wilson administration,
and there was still less over the
smaller but perhaps even more cynical stealings
that glorified the short reign of Harding; in the
latter case, in fact, most of the odium settled upon
the specialists in righteousness who laid the
thieves by the heels. The soldiers coming home
from the War for Democracy did not demand
that the war profiteers be jailed; they simply demanded
that they themselves be paid enough to
make up the difference between what they got for
fighting for their country and what they might
have stolen had they escaped the draft. Their
chief indignation was lavished, not upon the airship
contractors who made off with a billion, but
upon their brothers who were paid $10 a day in
the shipyards. The feats of the former were
beyond their grasp, but those of the latter they
could imagine—and envy.</p>

<p>This fellow feeling for thieves is probably
what makes capitalism so secure in democratic
societies. Under absolutism it is always in
danger, and not infrequently, as history teaches,
it is exploited and undone, but under democracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
it is safe. Democratic man can understand the
aims and aspirations of capitalism; they are,
greatly magnified, simply his own aims and aspirations.
Thus he tends to be friendly to it,
and to view with suspicion those who propose to
overthrow it. The new system, whatever its nature,
would force him to invent a whole new outfit
of dreams, and that is always a difficult and
unpleasant business, to workers in the ditch as
to philosophers in the learned grove. Capitalism
under democracy has a further advantage: its
enemies, even when it is attacked, are scattered
and weak, and it is usually easily able to array
one half of them against the other half, and thus
dispose of both. That is precisely what happened
in the United States after the late war.
The danger that confronted capitalism was then
a double one. On the one side there was the tall
talk that the returning conscripts, once they got
out of uniform, would demand the punishment of
the patriots who had looted the public treasury
while they were away. On the other side there
was an uneasy rumour that a war <i>Katzenjammer</i>
was heavily upon them, and that they would demand
a scientific inquiry into the true causes and
aims of the war, and into the manner and purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of their own uncomfortable exploitation.
This double danger was quickly met and turned
off, and by the simple device of diverting the
bile of the conscripts against those of their own
class who had escaped servitude, to wit, the
small group of draft-dodgers and conscientious
objectors and the larger group of political radicals,
who were represented to be slackers in theory
if not in fact. Thus one group of victims
was set upon the other, and the fact that both
had a grievance against their joint exploiters was
concealed and forgotten. Mob fears, easily
aroused, aided in the achievement of the <i lang="fr">coup</i>.
Within a few weeks gallant bands of American
Legionaries were hunting Reds down all the
back-alleys of the land, and gaudily butchering
them, when found, at odds of a hundred to one.
I know of nothing more indicative of the strength
of capitalism under democracy than this melodramatic
and extremely amusing business. The
scheme succeeded admirably, and it deserved
to succeed, for it was managed with laudable
virtuosity, and it was based upon a shrewd understanding
of democratic psychology.</p>

<p>I believe that every other emergency that is
likely to arise, at least in the United States, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
be dealt with in the same adroit and effective
manner. The same thing has been done in
other democratic states: I point to the so-called
general strike in England in 1926, which was
wrecked by pitting half of the proletariat against
the other half. The capitalistic system now enlists
the best brains in all the democratic nations,
including France and Germany, and I believe
that, instead of losing such support hereafter, it
will get more and more of it. As the old aristocracies
decline, the plutocracy is bound to inherit
their hegemony, and to have the support
of the nether mob. An aristocratic society may
hold that a soldier or a man of learning is superior
to a rich manufacturer or banker, but in a
democratic society the latter are inevitably put
higher, if only because their achievement is more
readily comprehended by the inferior man, and
he can more easily imagine himself, by some
favour of God, duplicating it. Thus the imponderable
but powerful force of public opinion
directs the aspirations of all the more alert and
ambitious young men toward business, and what
is so assiduously practised tends to produce experts.
E.&nbsp;W. Howe, I incline to think, is quite
right when he argues that the average American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
banker or business man, whatever his demerits
otherwise, is at least more competent professionally
than the average American statesman,
musician, painter, author, labour leader, scholar,
theologian or politician. Think of the best
American poet of our time, or the best soldier,
or the best violoncellist, and then ask yourself
if his rank among his fellows in the world is
seriously to be compared with that of the late
J. Pierpont Morgan among financial manipulators,
or that of John D. Rockefeller among
traders. The capitalists, in fact, run the country,
as they run all democracies: they emerged
in Germany, after the republic arose from the
ruins of the late war, like Anadyomene from
the sea. They organize and control the minorities
that struggle eternally for power, and so get
a gradually firmer grip upon the government.
One by one they dispose of such demagogues as
Bryan and Roosevelt, and put the helm of state
into the hands of trusted and reliable men—McKinley,
Harding, Coolidge. In England, Germany
and France they patronize, in a somewhat
wistful way, what remains of the old aristocracies.
In the United States, through such agents
as the late Gompers, they keep Demos penned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
in a gilt and glittering cage. Public opinion?
Walter Lippmann, searching for it, could not
find it. A century before him Fichte said “<i lang="de">es
gar nicht existirte</i>.” Public opinion, in its raw
state, gushes out in the immemorial form of the
mob’s fears. It is piped to central factories,
and there it is flavoured and coloured, and put
into cans.</p>

<p><i>The Future of Democracy</i></p>

<p>Whether or not democracy is destined to survive
in the world until the corruptible puts on
incorruption and the immemorial Christian dead
leap out of their graves, their faces shining and
their yells resounding—this is something, I confess,
that I don’t know, nor is it necessary, for
the purposes of the present inquiry, that I venture
upon the hazard of a guess. My business
is not prognosis, but diagnosis. I am not engaged
in therapeutics, but in pathology. That
simple statement of fact, I daresay, will be accepted
as a confession, condemning me out of
hand as unfit for my task, and even throwing a
certain doubt upon my <i lang="la">bona fides</i>. For it is one
of the peculiar intellectual accompaniments of
democracy that the concept of the insoluble becomes
unfashionable—nay, almost infamous.
To lack a remedy is to lack the very license to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
discuss disease. The causes of this are to be
sought, without question, in the nature of democracy
itself. It came into the world as a
cure-all, and it remains primarily a cure-all to
this day. Any boil upon the body politic, however
vast and raging, may be relieved by taking
a vote; any flux of blood may be stopped by
passing a law. The aim of government is to repeal
the laws of nature, and re-enact them with
moral amendments. War becomes simply a device
to end war. The state, a mystical emanation
from the mob, takes on a transcendental potency,
and acquires the power to make over the father
which begat it. Nothing remains inscrutable
and beyond remedy, not even the way of a man
with a maid. It was not so under the ancient and
accursed systems of despotism, now happily
purged out of the world. They, too, I grant you,
had certain pretensions of an homeric gaudiness,
but they at least refrained from attempts to
abolish sin, poverty, stupidity, cowardice, and
other such immutable realities. Mediæval
Christianity, which was a theological and philosophical
<em>apologia</em> for those systems, actually
erected belief in that immutability into a cardinal
article of faith. The evils of the world were incurable:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
one put off the quest for a perfect moral
order until one got to heaven, <i lang="la">post mortem</i>.
There arose, in consequence, a scheme of checks
and balances that was consummate and completely
satisfactory, for it could not be put to a
test, and the logical holes in it were chinked with
miracles. But no more. To-day the Holy
Saints are deposed. Now each and every human
problem swings into the range of practical politics.
The worst and oldest of them may be
solved facilely by travelling bands of lady
Ph.D.’s, each bearing the mandate of a Legislature
of kept men, all unfaithful to their protectors.</p>

<p>Democracy becomes a substitute for the old
religion, and the antithesis of it: the Ku
Kluxers, though their reasoning may be faulty,
are not far off the facts in their conclusion that
Holy Church is its enemy. It shows all the magical
potency of the great systems of faith. It has
the power to enchant and disarm; it is not vulnerable
to logical attack. I point for proof to
the appalling gyrations and contortions of its
chief exponents. Read, for example, the late
James Bryce’s “Modern Democracies.” Observe
how he amasses incontrovertible evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
that democracy doesn’t work—and then concludes
with a stout declaration that it does. Or, if
his two fat volumes are too much for you, turn
to some school reader and give a judicious perusal
to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, with its
argument that the North fought the Civil War
to save self-government to the world!—a thesis
echoed in falsetto, and by feebler men, fifty
years later. It is impossible, by any device
known to philosophers, to meet doctrines of that
sort; they obviously lie outside the range of
logical ideas. There is, in the human mind, a
natural taste for such hocus-pocus. It greatly
simplifies the process of ratiocination, which is
unbearably painful to the great majority of men.
What dulls and baffles the teeth may be got down
conveniently by an heroic gulp. No doubt there
is an explanation here of the long-continued popularity
of the dogma of the Trinity, which remains
unstated in plain terms after two thousand
years. And no doubt the dogma of Transubstantiation
came under fire in the Reformation
because it had grown too simple and comprehensible—because
even the Scholastic philosophy
had been unable to convert its plain propositions
into something that could be believed without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
being understood. Democracy is shot through
with this delight in the incredible, this banal
mysticism. One cannot discuss it without colliding
with preposterous postulates, all of them
cherished like authentic hairs from the whiskers
of Moses himself. I have alluded to its touching
acceptance of the faith that progress is illimitable
and ordained of God—that every human
problem, in the very nature of things, may be
solved. There are corollaries that are even more
naïve. One, for example, is to the general effect
that optimism is a virtue in itself—that
there is a mysterious merit in being hopeful and
of glad heart, even in the presence of adverse
and immovable facts. This curious notion turns
the glittering wheels of Rotary, and is the motive
power of the political New Thoughters called
Liberals. Certainly the attitude of the average
American Liberal toward the so-called League of
Nations offered superb clinical material to the
student of democratic psychopathology. He began
by arguing that the League would save the
world. Confronted by proofs of its fraudulence,
he switched to the doctrine that believing
in it would save the world. So, later on, with
the Washington Disarmament Conference. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
man who hopes absurdly, it appears, is in some
fantastic and gaseous manner a better citizen
than the man who detects and exposes the truth.
Bear this sweet democratic axiom clearly in
mind. It is, fundamentally, what is the matter
with the United States.</p>

<p>As I say, my present mandate does not oblige
me to conjure up a system that will surpass and
shame democracy as democracy surpasses and
shames the polity of the Andaman Islanders or
the Great Khan—a system full-blown and perfect,
like Prohibition, and ready to be put into
effect by the simple adoption of an amendment
to the Constitution. Such a system, for all I
know, may lie outside the farthest soarings of
the human mind, though that mind can weigh the
stars and know God. Until the end of the chapter
the ants and bees may flutter their sardonic
antennæ at us in that department, as they do in
others: the last joke upon man may be that he
never learned how to govern himself in a rational
and competent manner, as the last joke
upon woman may be that she never had a baby
without wishing that the Day of Judgment were
a week past. I am not even undertaking to prove
here that democracy is too full of evils to be further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
borne. On the contrary, I am convinced
that it has some valuable merits, not often described,
and I shall refer to a few of them presently.
All I argue is that its manifest defects,
if they are ever to be got rid of at all, must be
got rid of by examining them realistically—that
they will never cease to afflict all the more puissant
and exemplary nations so long as discussing
them is impeded by concepts borrowed from
theology. As for me, I have never encountered
any actual evidence, convincing to an ordinary
jury, that <i lang="la">vox populi</i> is actually <i lang="la">vox Dei</i>. The
proofs, indeed, run the other way. The life of
the inferior man is one long protest against the
obstacles that God interposes to the attainment
of his dreams, and democracy, if it is anything
at all, is simply one way of getting ’round those
obstacles. Thus it represents, not a jingling
echo of what seems to be the divine will, but a
raucous defiance of it. To that extent, perhaps,
it is truly civilized, for civilization, as I have argued
elsewhere, is best described as an effort to
remedy the blunders and check the cruel humours
of the Cosmic Kaiser. But what is defiant is
surely not official, and what is not official is
open to examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>For all I know, democracy may be a self-limiting
disease, as civilization itself seems to be.
There are obvious paradoxes in its philosophy,
and some of them have a suicidal smack. It
offers John Doe a means to rise above his place
beside Richard Roe, and then, by making Roe his
equal, it takes away the chief usufructs of the
rising. I here attempt no pretty logical gymnastics:
the history of democratic states is a history
of disingenuous efforts to get rid of the
second half of that dilemma. There is not only
the natural yearning of Doe to use and enjoy the
superiority that he has won; there is also the
natural tendency of Roe, as an inferior man, to
acknowledge it. Democracy, in fact, is always
inventing class distinctions, despite its theoretical
abhorrence of them. The baron has departed,
but in his place stand the grand goblin, the supreme
worthy archon, the sovereign grand commander.
Democratic man, as I have remarked,
is quite unable to think of himself as a free individual;
he must belong to a group, or shake
with fear and loneliness—and the group, of
course, must have its leaders. It would be hard
to find a country in which such brummagem
serene highnesses are revered with more passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
devotion than they get in the United States.
The distinction that goes with mere office runs far
ahead of the distinction that goes with actual
achievement. A Harding is regarded as genuinely
superior to a Halsted, no doubt because his
doings are better understood. But there is a
form of human striving that is understood by
democratic man even better than Harding’s, and
that is the striving for money. Thus the plutocracy,
in a democratic state, tends to take the
place of the missing aristocracy, and even to be
mistaken for it. It is, of course, something
quite different. It lacks all the essential characters
of a true aristocracy: a clean tradition,
culture, public spirit, honesty, honour, courage—above
all, courage. It stands under no bond
of obligation to the state; it has no public duty;
it is transient and lacks a goal. Its most puissant
dignitaries of to-day came out of the mob
only yesterday—and from the mob they bring all
its peculiar ignobilities. As practically encountered,
the plutocracy stands quite as far from the
<i lang="fr">honnête homme</i> as it stands from the Holy Saints.
Its main character is its incurable timorousness;
it is for ever grasping at the straws held out
by demagogues. Half a dozen gabby Jewish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
youths, meeting in a back room to plan a revolution—in
other words, half a dozen kittens preparing
to upset the Matterhorn—are enough to
scare it half to death. Its dreams are of banshees,
hobgoblins, bugaboos. The honest, untroubled
snores of a Percy or a Hohenstaufen are
quite beyond it.</p>

<p>The plutocracy, as I say, is comprehensible to
the mob because its aspirations are essentially
those of inferior men: it is not by accident that
Christianity, a mob religion, paves heaven with
gold and precious stones, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, with money.
There are, of course, reactions against this ignoble
ideal among men of more civilized tastes,
even in democratic states, and sometimes they
arouse the mob to a transient distrust of certain
of the plutocratic pretensions. But that distrust
seldom arises above mere envy, and the polemic
which engenders it is seldom sound in logic or
impeccable in motive. What it lacks is aristocratic
disinterestedness, born of aristocratic security.
There is no body of opinion behind it
that is, in the strictest sense, a free opinion. Its
chief exponents, by some divine irony, are pedagogues
of one sort or another—which is to say,
men chiefly marked by their haunting fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
losing their jobs. Living under such terrors,
with the plutocracy policing them harshly on one
side and the mob congenitally suspicious of them
on the other, it is no wonder that their revolt
usually peters out in metaphysics, and that they
tend to abandon it as their families grow up,
and the costs of heresy become prohibitive.
The pedagogue, in the long run, shows the virtues
of the Congressman, the newspaper editorial
writer or the butler, not those of the aristocrat.
When, by any chance, he persists in contumacy
beyond thirty, it is only too commonly a sign, not
that he is heroic, but simply that he is pathological.
So with most of his brethren of the Utopian
Fife and Drum Corps, whether they issue out of
his own seminary or out of the wilderness. They
are fanatics; not statesmen. Thus politics, under
democracy, resolves itself into impossible
alternatives. Whatever the label on the parties,
or the war cries issuing from the demagogues who
lead them, the practical choice is between the
plutocracy on the one side and a rabble of preposterous
impossibilists on the other. One must
either follow the New York <i>Times</i>, or one must
be prepared to swallow Bryan and the Bolsheviki.
It is a pity that this is so. For what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
democracy needs most of all is a party that will
separate the good that is in it theoretically from
the evils that beset it practically, and then try
to erect that good into a workable system. What
it needs beyond everything is a party of liberty.
It produces, true enough, occasional libertarians,
just as despotism produces occasional regicides,
but it treats them in the same drum-head way.
It will never have a party of them until it invents
and installs a genuine aristocracy, to breed
them and secure them.</p>


<h3 id="toclink_206">2.</h3>

<p><i>Last Words</i></p>

<p>I have alluded somewhat vaguely to the merits
of democracy. One of them is quite obvious: it
is, perhaps, the most charming form of government
ever devised by man. The reason is not
far to seek. It is based upon propositions that
are palpably not true—and what is not true, as
everyone knows, is always immensely more fascinating
and satisfying to the vast majority of
men than what is true. Truth has a harshness
that alarms them, and an air of finality that collides
with their incurable romanticism. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
turn, in all the great emergencies of life, to the
ancient promises, transparently false but immensely
comforting, and of all those ancient
promises there is none more comforting than
the one to the effect that the lowly shall inherit
the earth. It is at the bottom of the dominant
religious system of the modern world, and it is
at the bottom of the dominant political system.
The latter, which is democracy, gives it an even
higher credit and authority than the former,
which is Christianity. More, democracy gives
it a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable
truth. The mob man, functioning as
citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important
to the world—that he is genuinely running things.
Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and
mountebanks there comes to him a sense of vast
and mysterious power—which is what makes
archbishops, police sergeants, the grand goblins
of the Ku Klux and other such magnificoes
happy. And out of it there comes, too, a conviction
that he is somehow wise, that his views
are taken seriously by his betters—which is
what makes United States Senators, fortune-tellers
and Young Intellectuals happy. Finally,
there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
a high duty triumphantly done—which is what
makes hangmen and husbands happy.</p>

<p>All these forms of happiness, of course, are
illusory. They don’t last. The democrat, leaping
into the air to flap his wings and praise God,
is for ever coming down with a thump. The seeds
of his disaster, as I have shown, lie in his own
stupidity: he can never get rid of the naïve delusion—so
beautifully Christian!—that happiness
is something to be got by taking it away from
the other fellow. But there are seeds, too, in the
very nature of things: a promise, after all, is
only a promise, even when it is supported by
divine revelation, and the chances against its fulfilment
may be put into a depressing mathematical
formula. Here the irony that lies under all
human aspiration shows itself: the quest for happiness,
as always, brings only <em>un</em>happiness in
the end. But saying that is merely saying that
the true charm of democracy is not for the democrat
but for the spectator. That spectator, it
seems to me, is favoured with a show of the first
cut and calibre. Try to imagine anything more
heroically absurd! What grotesque false pretences!
What a parade of obvious imbecilities!
What a welter of fraud! But is fraud unamusing?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Then I retire forthwith as a psychologist.
The fraud of democracy, I contend, is more amusing
than any other—more amusing even, and by
miles, than the fraud of religion. Go into your
praying-chamber and give sober thought to any
of the more characteristic democratic inventions:
say, Law Enforcement. Or to any of the typical
democratic prophets: say, the late Archangel
Bryan. If you don’t come out paled and palsied
by mirth then you will not laugh on the Last Day
itself, when Presbyterians step out of the grave
like chicks from the egg, and wings blossom
from their scapulæ, and they leap into interstellar
space with roars of joy.</p>

<p>I have spoken hitherto of the possibility that
democracy may be a self-limiting disease, like
measles. It is, perhaps, something more: it
is self-devouring. One cannot observe it objectively
without being impressed by its curious
distrust of itself—its apparently ineradicable
tendency to abandon its whole philosophy at the
first sign of strain. I need not point to what
happens invariably in democratic states when
the national safety is menaced. All the great
tribunes of democracy, on such occasions, convert
themselves, by a process as simple as taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
a deep breath, into despots of an almost fabulous
ferocity. Lincoln, Roosevelt and Wilson
come instantly to mind: Jackson and Cleveland
are in the background, waiting to be recalled.
Nor is this process confined to times of alarm
and terror: it is going on day in and day out.
Democracy always seems bent upon killing the
thing it theoretically loves. I have rehearsed
some of its operations against liberty, the very
corner-stone of its political metaphysic. It not
only wars upon the thing itself; it even wars
upon mere academic advocacy of it. I offer the
spectacle of Americans jailed for reading the
Bill of Rights as perhaps the most gaudily humorous
ever witnessed in the modern world.
Try to imagine monarchy jailing subjects for
maintaining the divine right of Kings! Or
Christianity damning a believer for arguing that
Jesus Christ was the Son of God! This last,
perhaps, has been done: anything is possible in
that direction. But under democracy the remotest
and most fantastic possibility is a commonplace
of every day. All the axioms resolve
themselves into thundering paradoxes, many
amounting to downright contradictions in terms.
The mob is competent to rule the rest of us—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
it must be rigorously policed itself. There is
a government, not of men, but of laws—but men
are set upon benches to decide finally what the
law is and may be. The highest function of the
citizen is to serve the state—but the first assumption
that meets him, when he essays to discharge
it, is an assumption of his disingenuousness
and dishonour. Is that assumption commonly
sound? Then the farce only grows the more
glorious.</p>

<p>I confess, for my part, that it greatly delights
me. I enjoy democracy immensely. It is incomparably
idiotic, and hence incomparably
amusing. Does it exalt dunderheads, cowards,
trimmers, frauds, cads? Then the pain of seeing
them go up is balanced and obliterated by
the joy of seeing them come down. Is it inordinately
wasteful, extravagant, dishonest? Then
so is every other form of government: all alike
are enemies to laborious and virtuous men. Is
rascality at the very heart of it? Well, we have
borne that rascality since 1776, and continue to
survive. In the long run, it may turn out that
rascality is necessary to human government, and
even to civilization itself—that civilization, at
bottom, is nothing but a colossal swindle. I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
not know: I report only that when the suckers
are running well the spectacle is infinitely exhilarating.
But I am, it may be, a somewhat
malicious man: my sympathies, when it comes to
suckers, tend to be coy. What I can’t make out
is how any man can believe in democracy who
feels for and with them, and is pained when they
are debauched and made a show of. How can
any man be a democrat who is sincerely a democrat?</p>
